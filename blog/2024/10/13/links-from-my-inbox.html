Follow this itinerary for a mix of history, nature, and food.</p><p><strong>1. Shirakawago</strong><br>
<!-- -->Start your journey in <strong>Shirakawago</strong>, a mountain village known for its traditional <strong>Gassho-zukuri farmhouses</strong> and heavy winter snowfall. The buildings are arranged facing north to south to minimize wind resistance. Stay overnight in one of the <strong>farmhouses</strong> to fully experience the town.  </p><ul><li><strong>Don&#x27;t miss:</strong> The <strong>House of Pudding</strong>, serving Japan’s best custard pudding (2023 winner).</li></ul><p><strong>2. Takayama</strong><br>
<!-- -->Head to <strong>Takayama</strong>, a town in the Central Japan Alps, filled with <strong>traditional architecture</strong> and a retro vibe. Walk through the <strong>Old Town</strong>, and visit the <strong>Takayama Showa Museum</strong>, which perfectly captures Japan in the 1950s and 60s.  </p><ul><li><strong>Must-try food:</strong> <strong>Hida Wagyu beef</strong> is a local specialty, available in street food stalls or restaurants. You can enjoy a stick of wagyu for around <strong>600 yen</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Kyoto</strong><br>

Code is not an asset. We should have less of it, not more of it.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>Other thoughts on this topic:</p><p><strong>Martin Fowler</strong> (Agile advocate and software development thought leader) has expressed similar thoughts in his writings. In his blog post <em>&quot;Code as a Liability,&quot;</em> he explains that every line of code comes with maintenance costs, and the more code you have, the more resources are needed to manage it over time:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The more code you have, the more bugs you have. The more code you have, the harder it is to make changes.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><strong>John Ousterhout</strong>, a professor and computer scientist, has echoed this in his book <em>&quot;A Philosophy of Software Design.&quot;</em> He talks about <strong>code complexity</strong> and how more code often means more complexity, which in turn leads to more problems in the future:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The most important thing is to keep your code base as simple as possible.&quot;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><em>(GPT Summary)</em></p><p><a href="http://cppcheck.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cppcheck - A tool for static C/C++ code analysis</a></p><ol><li><p><strong>Dead Code Identification and Removal</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Importance of removing dead code</strong>: Dead code clutters the codebase, adds complexity, and increases maintenance costs. <strong>Action</strong>: Actively look for dead functions or features that are no longer in use. For example, if a feature has been deprecated but not fully removed, ensure its code is deleted.</li><li><strong>Techniques for identifying dead code</strong>: Use tools like static analysis, manual code review, or testing. <strong>Action</strong>: Rename the suspected dead function, rebuild, and let the compiler flag errors where the function is still being used.</li><li><strong>Using static analysis and compilers</strong>: These tools help identify unreachable or unused code. <strong>Action</strong>: Regularly run tools like <strong>CPPCheck</strong> or <strong>Clang Analyze</strong> in your CI pipeline to detect dead code.</li><li><strong>Renaming functions to detect dead code</strong>: A simple way to identify unused code. <strong>Action</strong>: Rename a function (e.g., <code>myFunction</code> to <code>myFunction_old</code>), and see if it causes errors during the build process. If not, the function is likely dead and can be safely removed.</li><li><strong>Deleting dead features and their subtle dependencies</strong>: Features often have dependencies that may be missed. <strong>Action</strong>: When removing a dead feature, check for subtle references, such as menu items, command-line flags, or other parts of the system that may still rely on it.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Caution with Large Codebase Changes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Taking small, careful steps</strong>: Removing too much at once can lead to major issues. <strong>Action</strong>: Remove a small function or part of the code, test, and repeat. For example, instead of removing an entire module, start with one function.</li><li><strong>Avoiding aggressive feature removal</strong>: Over-removal can cause unexpected failures. <strong>Action</strong>: Approach code deletion incrementally. Don’t aim to delete an entire feature at once; instead, tease out its components slowly to avoid breaking dependencies.</li><li><strong>Moving code to reduce scope</strong>: If code is not needed at the global scope, move it to a more local context. <strong>Action</strong>: Move public functions from header files to <code>.cpp</code> files and see if any errors occur. This can help isolate the function’s scope and make it easier to remove later.</li><li><strong>Risk of breaking builds</strong>: Avoid breaking the build with massive deletions. <strong>Action</strong>: Ensure you take incremental steps, test continuously, and use atomic commits to revert small changes if needed.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Refactoring Approaches</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Iterative refactoring and deletion</strong>: Refactor code in small steps to ensure stability. <strong>Action</strong>: When removing a dead function, check what other code depends on it. If a function calling it becomes unused, continue refactoring iteratively.</li><li><strong>Refactoring legacy code</strong>: Legacy code can often hide dead functions. <strong>Action</strong>: Slowly reduce the scope of legacy functions by moving them to lower levels (like <code>.cpp</code> files) to see if their usage drops. If not used anymore, delete them.</li><li><strong>Using unit tests for refactoring</strong>: Ensure that code works after refactoring. <strong>Action</strong>: Wrap legacy string classes or custom utility functions in unit tests, then replace the core logic with modern STL alternatives. If the tests pass, the old code can be removed safely.</li><li><strong>Replacing custom features with third-party libraries</strong>: Many custom solutions from the past can now be replaced by modern libraries. <strong>Action</strong>: If you have a custom logger class, consider replacing it with a more standardized and robust library like <strong>spdlog</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Working with Tools</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Using plugins or IDEs</strong>: Most modern IDEs can help identify dead code. <strong>Action</strong>: Use Visual Studio or IntelliJ plugins that flag unreachable code or highlight unused functions.</li><li><strong>Leveraging Compiler Explorer</strong>: Use online tools to isolate and test specific snippets of code. <strong>Action</strong>: If you can’t refactor in the main codebase, copy the function into <strong>Compiler Explorer</strong> (godbolt.org) and experiment with it there before making changes.</li><li><strong>Setting compiler flags</strong>: Enable warnings for unreachable or unused code. <strong>Action</strong>: Use <strong>-Wall</strong> or <strong>-Wextra</strong> in GCC or Clang to flag potentially dead code. For example, set <code>Wextra</code> in your build system to catch unused variables and unreachable code.</li><li><strong>Running static analysis tools</strong>: Integrate tools like <strong>CPPCheck</strong> into your CI pipeline. <strong>Action</strong>: Add <strong>CPPCheck</strong> to Jenkins and run it with <code>-j</code> to detect dead functions across multiple translation units.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Source Control Best Practices</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Atomic commits</strong>: Always break down deletions into small, reversible changes. <strong>Action</strong>: Commit changes one at a time and with meaningful messages, such as &quot;Deleted unused function <code>myFunction()</code>.&quot; This allows you to easily revert just one commit if needed.</li><li><strong>Small steps and green builds</strong>: Ensure the build passes after each commit. <strong>Action</strong>: Commit your changes, wait for the CI pipeline to return a green build, and only proceed if everything passes.</li><li><strong>Keeping history in the main branch</strong>: Deleting code in a branch risks losing history. <strong>Action</strong>: Perform deletions in the main branch with proper commit messages. In Git, avoid squashing commits when merging deletions, as this may obscure your work history.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Communication and Collaboration</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Educating teams about dead code</strong>: Not everyone understands the importance of cleaning up dead code. <strong>Action</strong>: When you find dead code, educate the team by documenting what you’ve removed and why.</li><li><strong>Communicating when deleting shared code</strong>: Deleting code that others may rely on needs consensus. <strong>Action</strong>: Start a conversation with the team and document the code you intend to delete. Make sure the removal won’t disrupt anyone’s work.</li><li><strong>Seasonal refactoring</strong>: Pick quieter periods like holidays for large-scale refactoring. <strong>Action</strong>: Plan code cleanups during slower times (e.g., Christmas or summer) when fewer developers are working. For example, take the three days between Christmas and New Year to remove unused code while avoiding merge conflicts.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Handling Legacy Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Addressing dead features tied to legacy systems</strong>: These can be tricky to remove without causing issues. <strong>Action</strong>: Mark features as deprecated first, communicate with stakeholders, and plan their removal after a safe period.</li><li><strong>Managing end-of-life features carefully</strong>: Inform customers and stakeholders before removing any external-facing features. <strong>Action</strong>: Announce the feature’s end-of-life, allow time for feedback, and only remove the feature after this period (e.g., six months).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Miscellaneous Code Cleanup</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Removing unnecessary includes</strong>: Many includes are added but never removed. <strong>Action</strong>: Comment out all include statements at the top of a file, then add them back one by one to see which ones are actually needed.</li><li><strong>Deleting repeated or needless code</strong>: Repeated code should be factored into functions or libraries. <strong>Action</strong>: If you find duplicated code, refactor it into a helper function or a shared library to reduce repetition.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Comments in Code</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Avoiding inane comments</strong>: Comments that explain obvious code operations are distracting. <strong>Action</strong>: Delete comments like “// increment i by 1” that explain simple logic you can deduce from reading the code.</li><li><strong>Recognizing risks in outdated comments</strong>: Old comments can hide the fact that code has changed. <strong>Action</strong>: When refactoring, ensure comments are either updated or removed to avoid misleading information about the code’s purpose.</li><li><strong>Focusing on clean code</strong>: Let the code speak for itself. <strong>Action</strong>: Favor well-written, self-explanatory code that requires minimal commenting.

This technique involves compiling the header files into an intermediate form that can be reused across different compilation units. By doing so, you significantly reduce the need to repeatedly process these files, cutting down the overall compilation time. Tools like <strong>CMake</strong> can automate this by managing dependencies and ensuring headers are correctly precompiled and reused across builds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parallel Compilation</strong>: Another approach is <strong>parallel compilation</strong>. Tools like <strong>Make</strong>, <strong>Ninja</strong>, and <strong>distcc</strong> allow you to compile multiple files simultaneously, taking advantage of multi-core processors. For instance, using the <code>-j</code> flag in <code>make</code> or <code>ninja</code> enables you to specify the number of jobs (i.e., compilation tasks) to run in parallel, which can dramatically reduce the time it takes to compile large projects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unity Builds</strong>: <strong>Unity builds</strong> are another technique where multiple source files are compiled together as a single compilation unit. This reduces the overhead caused by multiple compiler invocations and can be particularly useful for large codebases. However, unity builds can introduce some challenges, such as longer error messages and potential name collisions, so they should be used selectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code Optimization</strong>: Structuring your code to minimize dependencies can also be highly effective. Techniques include <strong>forward declarations</strong>, splitting projects into smaller modules with fewer interdependencies, and replacing heavyweight standard library headers with lighter alternatives when possible. By reducing the number of dependencies that need to be recompiled when a change is made, you can significantly decrease compile times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caching Compilation Results</strong>: Tools like <strong>ccache</strong> store previous compilation results, which can be reused if the source files haven’t changed. This approach is particularly useful in development environments where small, incremental changes are frequent.</p></li></ol><p>Here is the detailed digest from Andrew Pearcy&#x27;s talk on <strong>&quot;Reducing Compilation Times Through Good Design&quot;</strong>, along with the relevant project homepages and tools referenced throughout the discussion. </p><p><strong>Video Title:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItcGevumW-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reducing Compilation Times Through Good Design</a></p><p>Andrew Pearcy, an engineering team lead at Bloomberg, outlines strategies for significantly reducing C++ compilation times.

Long build times lead to context switching, reduced productivity, and delays in CI pipelines, affecting both local development experience and time to market. Additionally, longer compilation times make adopting static analysis tools like <strong>Clang-Tidy</strong> impractical due to the additional overhead. Reducing compilation time also optimizes resource utilization, especially in large companies where multiple machines are involved.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_DXrL" id="overview-of-the-c-compilation-model">Overview of the C++ Compilation Model<a class="hash-link" href="#overview-of-the-c-compilation-model" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>He recaps the <strong>C++ compilation model</strong>, breaking it down into phases: <strong>pre-processing</strong>, <strong>compilation</strong>, and <strong>linking</strong>. The focus is primarily on the first two stages.

The session covers measuring and improving performance, focusing on execution time, throughput, and memory allocations.</p><p><strong>Performance in Application Code</strong> Performance is measured by how quickly code executes, the throughput (how many tasks an application can handle in a given timeframe), and memory allocations. High memory allocations can lead to frequent garbage collections, impacting performance. Steve emphasizes that performance optimization is contextual, meaning not every application requires the same level of optimization.</p><p><strong>Optimization Cycle</strong> The optimization cycle involves measuring current performance, making small changes, and re-measuring to ensure improvements. Tools like Visual Studio profiling, PerfView, and JetBrains products are useful for profiling and measuring performance. BenchmarkDotNet is highlighted for micro-benchmarking, providing precise measurements by running benchmarks multiple times to get accurate data.</p><p><strong>High-Performance Code Techniques</strong></p><ol><li><strong><code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code></strong>: A type that provides a read/write view over contiguous memory, allowing for efficient slicing and memory operations. It is highly efficient with constant-time operations for slicing.</li><li><strong>Array Pool</strong>: A pool for reusing arrays to avoid frequent allocations and deallocations. Using the <code>ArrayPool&lt;T&gt;.Shared</code> pool allows for efficient memory reuse, reducing short-lived allocations.</li><li><strong>System.IO.Pipelines</strong>: Optimizes reading and writing streams by managing buffers and minimizing overhead. It is particularly useful in scenarios like high-performance web servers.</li><li><strong>System.Text.Json</strong>: A high-performance JSON API introduced in .NET Core 3. It includes low-level <code>Utf8JsonReader</code> and <code>Utf8JsonWriter</code> for zero-allocation JSON parsing, as well as higher-level APIs for serialization and deserialization.</li></ol><p><strong>Examples and Benchmarks</strong> Steve presents examples of using these APIs in real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant performance gains. For instance, using <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>ArrayPool</code> in a method that processes arrays and messages led to reduced execution time and memory allocations. Switching to <code>System.IO.Pipelines</code> and <code>System.Text.Json</code> resulted in similar improvements.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Slicing is really just changing the view over an existing block of memory... it&#x27;s a constant time, constant cost operation.&quot;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;Measure your code, don’t assume, don’t make assumptions with benchmarks, it’s dangerous.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Conclusion</strong> Optimizing .NET code with high-performance APIs requires careful measurement and iterative improvements. While not all applications need such optimizations, those that do can benefit from significant performance gains.

<em>Problem</em>: Candidates face multiple rounds of interviews (up to seven), causing frustration and inefficiency. Many find it counterproductive to go through so many technical interviews.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Overly complex hiring processes that assume more interviews lead to better candidates.
<em>Advice</em>: Implement a streamlined process with just <strong>one technical interview</strong> and <strong>one non-technical interview</strong>, each lasting no more than one hour. Long interview processes are unnecessary and may filter out good candidates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interview Redundancy (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: The same type of technical questions are asked repeatedly across different interviews, leading to duplication.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Lack of coordination among interviewers and reliance on similar types of technical questions.
<em>Advice</em>: Ensure <strong>each interviewer asks unique, relevant questions</strong> and does not rely on others to gather the same information. Interviewers should bear <strong>ultimate responsibility</strong> for gathering critical data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bias in Hiring (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Interview processes are biased because hiring managers may already have preferred candidates (referrals, strong portfolios) before the process begins.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Pre-existing relationships with candidates or prior work experience influence decisions.
<em>Advice</em>: Avoid dragging out the process to <strong>mask biases</strong>—shorter, efficient interviews can make the bias more visible but manageable. Long processes don&#x27;t necessarily filter out bias.</p></li><li><p><strong>Long Interview Processes Favor Privilege (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Prolonged interview panels select for candidates who can afford to take time off work, favoring those from more privileged backgrounds.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Candidates from less privileged backgrounds cannot afford to engage in drawn-out interviews.
<em>Advice</em>: Shorten the interview length and focus on relevant qualifications. Ensure accessibility for all candidates by keeping the process simple.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Interview Process Structure</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Diffusion of Responsibility (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: In group interview settings, responsibility for hiring decisions is diffused, leading to poor or delayed decision-making.
<em>Root Cause</em>: No single person feels accountable for making the final decision.
<em>Advice</em>: <strong>Assign ownership</strong> of decisions by giving specific interviewers responsibility for crucial aspects of the process. This reduces the likelihood of indecision and delayed outcomes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hiring Based on Team Fit vs. Technical Ability (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Emphasis on technical abilities often overshadows the importance of team compatibility.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Focus on technical skills without considering cultural and interpersonal dynamics within the team.
<em>Advice</em>: Ensure that interviews assess not only technical competence but also how well candidates <strong>fit into the team dynamic</strong>. Incorporate <strong>group discussions</strong> or <strong>casual settings</strong> (e.g., lunch meetings) to gauge team vibe.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambiguity in Interviewer Opinions (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Some interviewers avoid committing to clear opinions about candidates, preferring neutral stances.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Lack of confidence or fear of being overruled by the majority.
<em>Advice</em>: Use a <strong>rating system</strong> (e.g., 1–4 scale) that forces interviewers to choose a strong opinion, either in favor or against a candidate.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Candidate Experience and Behavior</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Negative Behavior in Interviews (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Candidates who perform well technically but exhibit unprofessional behavior (e.g., showing up late or hungover) can still pass through the hiring process.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Strong technical performance may overshadow concerns about professionalism and reliability.
<em>Advice</em>: Balance technical performance with <strong>non-technical evaluations</strong>. Weigh behaviors such as punctuality and professional demeanor just as heavily as coding skills.</p></li><li><p><strong>Take-Home Tests and Challenges (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Some candidates view take-home challenges as extra, unnecessary work, while others see them as a chance to showcase skills.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Different candidates have different preferences and responses to technical assessments.
<em>Advice</em>: <strong>Offer take-home tests</strong> as an option, but don&#x27;t make them mandatory. Adjust the evaluation method based on candidate preferences to ensure both parties feel comfortable.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Systemic Issues in the Hiring Process</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Healthcare Tied to Jobs (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: In the U.S., job-based healthcare forces candidates to accept positions they might not want or complicates transitions between jobs.
<em>Root Cause</em>: The healthcare system is tied to employment, making job transitions risky.
<em>Advice</em>: There&#x27;s no direct solution provided here, but <strong>highlighting the need for systemic changes</strong> in healthcare could make the hiring process more equitable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of Feedback to Candidates (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Many companies avoid giving feedback to candidates after interviews, leaving them unsure of their performance.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Fear of legal liability or workload concerns.
<em>Advice</em>: <strong>Provide constructive feedback</strong> to candidates, even if they aren&#x27;t selected. It helps build <strong>long-term relationships</strong> and contributes to positive company reputation. Some of the best connections come from transparent feedback post-interview.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Hiring for Senior Positions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Senior Candidates Have Low Tolerance for Long Processes (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Highly qualified senior candidates are more likely to decline long and drawn-out interview processes.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Senior candidates, due to their experience and expertise, are less willing to tolerate inefficient processes.
<em>Advice</em>: <strong>Streamline the process</strong> for senior roles. Keep interviews short, efficient, and focused on <strong>relevant discussions</strong>. High-level candidates prefer concise assessments over lengthy ones.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Hiring on Trust vs. Formal Interviews</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hiring Based on Relationships (00)</strong>:
<em>Problem</em>: Engineers with pre-existing relationships or referrals are more likely to be hired than those without, bypassing formal interviews.
<em>Root Cause</em>: Prior work relationships build trust, which can overshadow the need for formal vetting.
<em>Advice</em>: <strong>Trust-based hiring</strong> should be encouraged when there is prior working experience with the candidate. However, make efforts to balance trust with fairness by including formal evaluations where necessary.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Key Problems Summary</strong></p><ul><li>The <strong>length and complexity</strong> of the hiring process discourages many strong candidates, particularly <strong>senior-level</strong> applicants. Simplifying the process to <strong>two interviews</strong> (one technical and one non-technical) is recommended.</li><li><strong>Bias</strong> in the hiring process, particularly when managers have <strong>pre-existing relationships</strong> with candidates, leads to unfair outcomes.</li><li>Long interview processes <strong>favor privileged candidates</strong> who can afford to take time off, disadvantaging those from less privileged backgrounds.</li><li>Providing <strong>feedback</strong> to candidates is crucial for building long-term relationships and ensuring a positive hiring experience, yet it&#x27;s often avoided due to legal concerns.</li><li><strong>Team fit</strong> is just as important as technical skills, and companies should incorporate group interactions to assess interpersonal dynamics.</li></ul><p><strong>Most Critical Issues and Solutions</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Too many technical interviews create frustration and inefficiency.
<strong>Solution</strong>: Use just <strong>one technical and one non-technical</strong> interview, and assign responsibility for gathering all relevant information during these sessions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Bias due to pre-existing relationships.
<strong>Solution</strong>: Shorten the process to expose bias more clearly and <strong>rely on trust-based hiring</strong> only when balanced with formal interviews.</p></li><li><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Lack of feedback to candidates.
<strong>Solution</strong>: <strong>Provide constructive feedback</strong> to help candidates improve and establish long-term professional relationships.</p></li></ul></blockquote></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/2024/09/15/links-from-my-inbox"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Links from my inbox 2024-09-15</div></a></div></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_VRyP thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#-nice-watch" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">⌚ Nice watch!</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Disclaimer: The content on this website is my personal work and reflects my own views and opinions.
