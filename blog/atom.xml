Previously this happened pretty widely but generally under the table. (Is there any programmer who does not have a snippets folder or their own private library for scratching that one particular itch?) One of the great wrinkles that OSS throws into this is that OSS is public by default, and that's game changing.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>2022-11-29 <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/43-making-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post 43: Intentionally Making Close Friends — Neel Nanda</a></p><blockquote><p>One of the greatest sources of joy in my life are my close friends.

If boost::unordered_map strictly adheres to the C++ specification for std::unordered_map, boost::unordered_flat_map deviates in a number of ways from the standard to offer dramatic performance improvements in exchange; in fact, boost::unordered_flat_map ranks amongst the fastest hash containers currently available to C++ users.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>2022-11-17 <a href="https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM: Tools to set up a quick macOS VM in QEMU, accelerated by KVM.</a></p><blockquote><p> So... it is here in C++... because how else would you test your opensource C++ with no apple device?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>2022-11-13 <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnalogJ/scrutiny: Hard Drive S.M.A.R.T Monitoring, Historical Trends &amp; Real World Failure Thresholds</a></p><blockquote><p> If you run a server with more than a couple of hard drives, you're probably already familiar with S.M.A.R.T and the <code>smartd</code> daemon. If not, it's an incredible open source project described as the following:
smartd is a daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) system built into many ATA, IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of drive self-tests.

A cursor is a value that references an entry, and can be thought of like a divider in a filing cabinet—it separates the content that comes before it from the content that comes after it. The cursor given by the server will reference the next entry that comes after the last entry you received from the server response. To use our earlier alphabet example, after you receive the first set of results for A, B, and C, the cursor is set at D—the next entry that comes after the last entry you received.</p></blockquote></li><li>2022-08-27 <a href="https://staltz.com/time-till-open-source-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">André Staltz - Time Till Open Source Alternative</a><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">argosopentech/argos-translate: Open-source offline translation library written in Python</a><blockquote><p>Open-source offline translation library written in Python</p></blockquote></li><li>2022-08-27 <a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden Open Source Password Manager Bitwarden</a><blockquote><p>Password Manager

I recently transitioned from having lived my whole life doing the kind of jobs you could do with zero day’s training and no developed skills. I’ve heard the phrase (and some classier high-end equivalents) since then, but it’s used much differently; it’s describing a different set of worries as experienced by a different kind of person living a different sort of life.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Diary,</p><p>I remember, 8 years ago, back in Ukraine, I've used to run even several blogs.
Blogging was super helpful since I've been able to blog about my findings or results of my research and then find that note after some time. I've met a few like-minded friends because of my posts. This is a great tool. But then… I've stopped.</p><p>Because my English isn't perfect…
Because of lack of time, other things, video games…</p><p>Finally: the circle is now complete. I have not fixed all my issues before I have re-started the blogging, but, really, should I?</p><p>This is my official first post. I don't know what I will do in the future, but I am going to publish this right now.</p><p>Thanks to GitHub pages:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages Websites for you</a></li><li>[Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll]<!-- -->(<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.github.com/en/pages/</a>
