Nic explores modern C through thoughtfully edited, occasional long-form videos. Expect careful dives into data layout, performance tradeoffs, and why he built Clay, a single-header UI layout library in C, with clear explanations of the layout algorithm and practical usage. He posts when there is something substantial to show rather than on a fixed cadence, so uploads are infrequent but dense.
