## New Project Templates

2023-05-17 [cpp-best-practices/cmake_template](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cmake_template)

> "cmake_template" is a C++ Best Practices GitHub template designed for quick C++ project setups. Currently undergoing a major update, it enables Address Sanitizer, Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, treats warnings as errors, and performs static analysis using clang-tidy and cppcheck. It uses CPM for dependencies and provides a basic CLI example, testing examples, and a large Github action testing matrix. It requires cmake and a compiler to use. The project includes a simple usage example of FTXUI, featuring a game.

> This is a boiler plate for C++ projects. What you get:
>
> - Sources, headers and mains separated in distinct folders
> - Use of modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for much easier compiling
> - Setup for tests using [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)
> - Continuous testing with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), with support for C++17.
> - Code coverage reports, including automatic upload to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) and/or [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io/)
> - Code documentation with [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

> The 'tour' is a quick (254 pages + index, historical information, etc.) tutorial overview of all of standard C++ (language and standard library) at a moderately high level for people who already know C++ or at least are experienced programmers. It covers C++20 plus a few likely features of C++23.

  >  It covers the following topics and tips:
  >
  > - The concept and importance of **cache memory** and how it compensates for the difference in speed between processor and main memory.
  > - The principles of **temporal and spatial locality**, which govern the behavior of real-world programs and affect the cache performance.
  > - The tips and rules for **better exploiting the data cache** in different scenarios, such as:
  >   - Using **arrays** of classes or structs instead of values, to increase the cache utilization and reduce the cache misses.
  >   - Aligning the **starting address of the array** and the **class data** to the cache line size, to avoid splitting the data across multiple cache lines and to optimize the cache access.
  >   - Performing **loop interchange** on **matrices**, to move the loop over the innermost position and to eliminate column-wise accesses, which are costly for the cache.
  >   - Avoiding **padding** in **classes and structs**, to make sure they are correctly aligned and to reduce the cache overhead.
  >   - Sorting the **variables in the declaration** of the classes by size from largest to smallest, to guarantee that the compiler will not insert any padding and to optimize the cache access.
  > - The tools and references available to help with the data cache optimization, such as **pahole** and **StuctLayout**, which can help with exploring and visualizing the paddings in the classes.

  > Writing a unit test from scratch for an embedded software project is almost always an exercise in frustration, patience, and determination. This is because of the constraints, as well as breadth, of embedded software. It combines hardware drivers, operating systems, high-level software, and communication protocols and stacks all within one software package and is usually managed by a single team. Due to these complexities, the number of dependencies of a single file can quickly grow out of control.

>
> The architecture looks something like this:
>
> **Figure 1: CPU Cache**
>
> ![img](./dev-cpp.assets/182_figure1.png)

> Figure 1 shows the different layers of memory a piece of data has to travel to be accessible by the processor. Each CPU has its own L1 and L2 cache, and the L3 cache is shared among all CPUs. When the data finally makes its way inside the L1 or L2 cache, the processor can access it for execution purposes. On Intel architectures the L3 cache maintains a copy of what is in L1 and L2.
>
> Performance in the end is about how efficiently data can flow into the processor. As you can see from the diagram, main memory access is about 80 times slower than accessing the L1 cache since the data needs to be moved and copied.
>
> *Note: [Memory Performance in a Nutshell](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/memory-performance-in-a-nutshell.html): The data is from 2016 but what’s important are the latency ratios which are pretty constant.*

> If I give a programmer a string such as `"9223372036854775808"` and I ask them to convert it to an integer, they might do the following in C++:

```cpp
std::string s = ....

auto [ptr, ec] =
std::from_chars(s.data(), s.data() + s.size(), val);
if (ec != std::errc()) {} // I have an error !

## Compilers

2023-12-01 [Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++ | OpenSSF Best Practices Working Group](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html)

TL;DR: What compiler options should I use?

When compiling C or C++ code on compilers such as GCC and clang, turn on these flags for detecting vulnerabilities at compile time and enable run-time protection mechanisms:

```
-O2 -Wall -Wformat=2 -Wconversion -Wimplicit-fallthrough \
-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 \
-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS \
-fstrict-flex-arrays=3 \
-fstack-clash-protection -fstack-protector-strong \
-Wl,-z,nodlopen -Wl,-z,noexecstack \
-Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now
```

Note that support for some options may differ between different compilers, e.g. support for [`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3) varies depending on the compiler[2](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#fn:Guelton20) and C standard library implementations. See the discussion below for [background](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#background) and for [detailed discussion of each option](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html#recommended-compiler-options).

When compiling code in any of the situations in the below table, add the corresponding additional options:

| When                 | Additional options flags                                     |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| using GCC            | `-Wtrampolines`                                              |
| for executables      | `-fPIE -pie`                                                 |
| for shared libraries | `-fPIC -shared`                                              |
| for x86_64           | `-fcf-protection=full`                                       |
| for aarch64          | `-mbranch-protection=standard`                               |
| for production code  | `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks -fno-strict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` |

```
It's _MSC_VER. More info at MSDN and at predef.

But, be aware that some other compilers may also define it, e.g. Intel's C++ Compiler for Windows also defines _MSC_VER. If this is a concern, use #if _MSC_VER && !__INTEL_COMPILER.

> Reading the excellent article by JeanHeyd Meneide on [how broken string encoding in C/C++ is](https://thephd.dev/the-c-c++-rust-string-text-encoding-api-landscape) made me realise that Unicode is a topic that is often overlooked by a large number of developers. In my experience, there’s a lot of confusion and wrong expectations on what Unicode is, and what best practices to follow when dealing with strings that may contain characters outside of the ASCII range.

> What are lock-free data structures?
> Lock-free data structures are data structures that are thread and interrupt safe without having to use mutual exclusion mechanisms. Lock-free data structures are most useful for inter process communication, but due to the efficiency of lockfree, it can safely be used for single threaded uses as well, making it good for general purpose use.

>  These monadic types not only make error handling easier but also make the paths more obvious to the compiler for optimizations. Monads can be simply thought of as abstract types of actions. Their monadic nature makes it easy to operate on them as pipelines and in the process eliminate redundant error-handling logic code.
