MCP clients typically load all tool definitions into the system prompt, then run multi step flows like gdrive.find_document followed by gdrive.get_document, then another tool, and so on. Every tool definition and every intermediate result lives in the context window, so each new tool call resends the whole history as input tokens.

Tools become normal functions in a file tree, and the model discovers and imports only what it needs. Most of the heavy lifting happens in code, not in the LLM context. That cuts token usage dramatically, makes workflows faster, and lets the model leverage what it is actually good at, which is writing and navigating code rather than juggling hundreds of tool definitions and transcripts."),(0,i.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"This code first approach also solves privacy, composition, and state in a more normal way. Large documents, big tables, and joined data can be filtered, aggregated, and matched in code, then only the small, relevant results are sent back to the model. Sensitive fields can be tokenized before they ever reach the LLM and untokenized only when communicating between backends like Google Sheets and Salesforce. State can live in memory or in files, and reusable workflows can be saved as functions or skills, which starts to look a lot like conventional SDKs and libraries.")))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},4720:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251102114702224-4c78f936978015b50094921ed9e31148.png"},66771:function(e,t){t.Z="data:image/png;base64,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
