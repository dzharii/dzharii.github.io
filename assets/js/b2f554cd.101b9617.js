I recently transitioned from having lived my whole life doing the kind of jobs you could do with zero day\u2019s training and no developed skills. I\u2019ve heard the phrase (and some classier high-end equivalents) since then, but it\u2019s used much differently; it\u2019s describing a different set of worries as experienced by a different kind of person living a different sort of life.\\n> The Author - [Resident Contrarian on Substack](https://substack.com/profile/11885401-resident-contrarian) - writes about different kinds of people issues.\\n\\n## Good old reads\\n- 2022-05-16 [Crash-only software: More than meets the eye LWN.net](https://lwn.net/Articles/191059/)\\n- 2022-05-16 [Crash-Only Thinking](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/10/29/crash-only-thinking/)\\n> A few weeks ago, I learned about something called crash-only software (ht, Robert Greco). This is software that has no normal \u201cstart\u201d or \u201cstop\u201d mechanisms. It can only be stopped by crashing it. Often this means unplugging the computer physically.\\n- 2022-05-16 [The properties of crash-only software - Marc\'s Blog](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2012/01/22/crash-only.html)\\n> My thoughts about a classic paper\\n- 2022-05-21 [Crash-only software: More than meets the eye 2006 Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8464573)\\n```\\nBecause of that I usually make all my services and systems crash only. End up using things like use atomic file moves, open files with append-only, use kill -9 to stop services and so on. To make your system crash-onl,y you have to go down the base system calls.\\nSome observed effects so far (many are covered in the article):\\n* Faster restarts (if your regular operation involves restarting lots of processes).\\n* Less code (don\'t have to handle both the clean shutdown and dirty shutdown).\\n* Recovery/cleanup code if it is needed, is often ends up moved to startup instead of shutdown (you might have to recover corrupt files when you start up again. For example re-truncate the files to a known offset based on some index).\\n* Something else might need to manage external resources (OS IPC resources, shared memory, IPC message queues etc). This could be a supervisor process.\\n* If you do a lot of socket operations on localhost, your sockets could get stuck in TIME_WAIT state and you\'ll eventually run out of ephemeral ports if you do a lot of restarts (say during testing). SIGTERM signals often are caught and processes (libraries) perform a cleaner shutdown.\\n* Think very well about the database you use and see if it can can support crash only operation. Some do some don\'t ( I won\'t name any names here ).\\n```\\n- 2022-05-21 [Files are hard](https://danluu.com/file-consistency/)\\n> on exactly how hard it is to save data without corruption or data loss \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## How the things work\\n- 2022-05-14 [Time-series compression algorithms, explained](https://www.timescale.com/blog/time-series-compression-algorithms-explained/)\\n> Delta-delta encoding, Simple-8b, XOR-based compression, and more - These algorithms aren\'t magic, but combined they can save over 90% of storage costs and speed up queries.
