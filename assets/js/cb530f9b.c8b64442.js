the talk:"),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"I started with a light-hearted introduction about my cultural background and how it relates to having a siesta after lunch, which isn\u2019t an option today since I'm giving this talk. About a decade ago, I was working on a project where we were building a retail system from scratch for a client. Initially, we created a ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"monolithic architecture"),", which worked well for a while. However, as the business grew, we faced challenges. We saw increased demand and the architecture started showing its limitations. We experienced issues like ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"failed requests, high strain on the database"),", and even system crashes."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"Given the new demands, we decided to evolve our architecture by moving to a ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"message-based system"),". We hoped this would solve our problems by improving performance, increasing resilience, and allowing easier scaling. However, we quickly realized that the transition wasn\u2019t as smooth as expected. Instead of getting faster, the system became slower, and we started experiencing issues with ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"UI inconsistency"),". Customers reported cases where the system didn't reflect their actions, leading to confusion and a poor user experience. We also encountered ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"duplicate messages and messages arriving out of order"),", which led to significant failures and side effects in the system."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"One critical lesson we learned was the importance of understanding the ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"shift from synchronous to asynchronous communication"),". In a synchronous system, there's a direct, immediate response. But in an asynchronous system, messages might take a while to process, leading to delays and out-of-order execution. This can cause unexpected behaviors in the system, making troubleshooting a lot more challenging."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"To address the issues with ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"communication patterns"),", we explored different messaging patterns like ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"one-way communication, request-response, and publish-subscribe"),'. Each has its use case, but we learned that choosing the right pattern is crucial for system stability. For instance, publish-subscribe can be overused, leading to what I call the "passive-aggressive publisher" problem, where a service publishes an event expecting others to act on it, but without direct control, this can cause problems.'),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"A key takeaway is that ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"decoupling")," doesn\u2019t happen automatically in a message-based system. It requires deliberate effort to identify service boundaries and manage coupling properly. When splitting a monolith, it\u2019s crucial to ask the right questions about the domain and not just accept the default ordering of processes. For example, questioning whether the order in which tasks are executed is necessary can help in finding opportunities for parallel execution, thereby improving efficiency."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"We also found that managing ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"SLA (Service Level Agreements)")," became essential in an asynchronous environment. We started using ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"delayed messages")," to ensure that tasks were completed within an acceptable time frame. This helped us recover gracefully from both technical and business failures, like handling payment processing delays or credit card issues."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"In the end, it\u2019s not just about transitioning to a new architecture but about understanding the trade-offs and challenges that come with it. The key is to balance the benefits of decoupling with the need to maintain order and consistency in the system. By carefully choosing the right communication patterns and managing the inevitable coupling, we can build systems that are both scalable and resilient, even in the face of growing demand."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"This journey taught us that evolving a system architecture isn\u2019t just about adopting new technologies but also about adapting our approach to fit the new reality.
