For example re-truncate the files to a known offset based on some index).\n* Something else might need to manage external resources (OS IPC resources, shared memory, IPC message queues etc). This could be a supervisor process.\n* If you do a lot of socket operations on localhost, your sockets could get stuck in TIME_WAIT state and you'll eventually run out of ephemeral ports if you do a lot of restarts (say during testing). SIGTERM signals often are caught and processes (libraries) perform a cleaner shutdown.\n* Think very well about the database you use and see if it can can support crash only operation.
