They can scaffold entire features in minutes, complete with tests and documentation. But watch carefully, and you\'ll notice something crucial: They\'re not just accepting what the AI suggests. They\'re constantly:\\n>\\n> - Refactoring the generated code into smaller, focused modules\\n> - Adding edge case handling the AI missed\\n> - Strengthening type definitions and interfaces\\n> - Questioning architectural decisions\\n> - Adding comprehensive error handling\\n>\\n> In other words, they\'re applying years of hard-won engineering wisdom to shape and constrain the AI\'s output. The AI is accelerating their implementation, but their expertise is what keeps the code maintainable.\\n>\\n> **The knowledge paradox:** Here\'s the most counterintuitive thing I\'ve discovered: AI tools help experienced developers more than beginners. This seems backward \u2013 shouldn\'t AI democratize coding?\\n>\\n> The reality is that AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team. They can write code quickly, but they need constant supervision and correction. The more you know, the better you can guide them.\\n>\\n> **This creates what I call the \\"knowledge paradox\\":**\\n>\\n> - Seniors use AI to accelerate what they already know how to do\\n> - Juniors try to use AI to learn what to do\\n> - The results differ dramatically\\n>\\n> **I\'ve watched senior engineers use AI to:**\\n>\\n> - Rapidly prototype ideas they already understand\\n> - Generate basic implementations they can then refine\\n> - Explore alternative approaches to known problems\\n> - Automate routine coding tasks\\n>\\n> **Meanwhile, juniors often:**\\n>\\n> - Accept incorrect or outdated solutions\\n> - Miss critical security and performance considerations\\n> - Struggle to debug AI-generated code\\n> - Build fragile systems they don\'t fully understand\\n\\n2024-12-16 [A 10 Year Retrospective of a Passionate Software Engineer | by Boris Cherkasky | Nov, 2024 | Medium](https://cherkaskyb.medium.com/a-10-year-retrospective-of-a-passionate-software-engineer-2d0cd7b3d836) { cherkaskyb.medium.com }\\n\\n> found in [programmingdigest issue1798](https://programmingdigest.net/newsletters/1798) { programmingdigest.net }\\n>\\n> ![image-20241215213500854](./2024-12-29-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241215213500854.png)\\n>\\n> **Take Ownership of Your Career**\\n> No one is responsible for your career growth but you. While managers may offer guidance, the responsibility to seek opportunities, take initiative, and drive your own development is yours alone. Waiting for someone else to guide your progression will leave you stagnant.\\n>\\n> > \\"No one is responsible for your career path but you.\\"\\n>\\n> **Seek Mentorship \u2014 It\u2019s a Shortcut to Mastery**\\n> A mentor can accelerate your growth by giving you insights, sharing their decision-making process, and exposing you to higher-level thinking. Actively seek out senior engineers, build relationships, and ask questions. This can be one of the most effective ways to \\"level up\\" faster than self-learning alone.\\n>\\n> > \\"Having a mentor is a force multiplier! It\u2019s literally a means to learn faster, it\u2019s a shortcut!\\"\\n>\\n> **Initiative is Always Rewarded**\\n> No employer will think less of you for taking initiative. If something is blocked, find a way around it. Push for better solutions, offer new ideas, and take on challenges without being asked. This attitude of \\"full ownership\\" sets you apart. Engineers who \\"unblock themselves\\" \u2014 even by learning disciplines outside their core expertise \u2014 become the most valuable contributors.\\n>\\n> > \\"Nothing is more important than making your colleagues feel comfortable and safe working with you.\\"\\n>\\n> **The Dunning-Kruger Effect is Real \u2014 Be Humble and Self-Aware**\\n> At some point, you will overestimate your own skills. Recognizing this gap is essential for growth. Take feedback seriously, reflect on your mistakes, and focus on learning through deliberate practice. Switch from \\"just get it done\\" to \\"learn all you need to do it right.\\" This mindset shift will elevate your skill set.\\n>\\n> **Master the \\"Glue Work\\" That Holds Teams Together**\\n> It\u2019s not enough to just write code. The ability to **coordinate, track, and organize work** is a rare and valuable skill. Acting as the \\"glue\\" between people, projects, and teams will make you indispensable. Track tickets, follow up on blockers, and ensure no one is left behind. Great engineers don\u2019t just \\"code\\" \u2014 they also **lead, unblock, and delegate**.\\n>\\n> **Technical Excellence is Necessary, But Not Sufficient**\\n> You can be a great coder, but without skills like **communication, empathy, and coordination**, you won\u2019t become a senior engineer. Learn to **bridge the gap between engineers, product managers, and customers**. Senior engineers know how to translate customer requirements into engineering solutions and help their teams grow.\\n>\\n> **Learn to See the Business, Not Just the Code**\\n> As you grow in your career, it\u2019s not just about building \\"good\\" software \u2014 it\u2019s about building software that drives **business outcomes**. Learn to ask, \\"How will this impact our KPIs?\\" and prioritize cost-efficient, high-impact solutions. This business-first mindset can distinguish you as a senior engineer and lead to better decision-making.\\n>\\n> > \\"At one point, we scratched the \'optimal solution\' for a good enough, 10x cheaper solution. Engineering is all about tradeoffs.\\"\\n>\\n> **Resilience and Observability Are Non-Negotiable Skills**\\n> Handling production incidents teaches you to value **system reliability, observability, and DevOps**. As you progress, mastering **monitoring, alerting, and on-call response** will become essential. Developers who \\"speak infrastructure\\" become highly valuable, as they can ensure stability and avoid system failure.\\n>\\n> > \\"It became clear that being a developer that \'speaks\' and understands infrastructure is a superpower, and a differentiating factor.\\"\\n>\\n> **Continuous Learning is Not Optional**\\n> The craft of software engineering evolves rapidly. Relying on daily work alone will not keep you at the top. You need to invest in side learning \u2014 read books like *Clean Code* and *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, attend meetups, seek mentorship, and watch technical talks. Growth requires time and passion outside daily tasks.\\n>\\n> > \\"Learning through daily tasks is not enough for becoming a top-tier engineer. The craft and technology are just too complex and require a lot of passion and time.\\"\\n>\\n> **Be a Decent Human Being \u2014 It Matters More Than You Think**\\n> Nothing beats being a kind, respectful, and empathetic teammate. People remember how you make them feel. Psychological safety and trust are essential for high-performing teams. As you grow into senior roles, prioritize creating safe, welcoming environments where people can speak up, share ideas, and fail without fear of judgment.\\n>\\n> > \\"Nothing \u2014 and I mean it \u2014 Nothing! is more important than being a decent human being, a pleasant colleague, and a pragmatic engineer.\\"\\n\\n2024-12-15 [Preferring throwaway code over design docs](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2024/12/14/throwaway-prs-not-design-docs) { softwaredoug.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241215151801822](./2024-12-29-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241215151801822.png)\\n>\\n> Another important point is on using PRs for documentation. They are one of the best forms of documentation for devs. They\u2019re discoverable - one of the first places you look when trying to understand why code is implemented a certain way. PRs don\u2019t profess to reflect the current state of the world, but a state at a point in time. A historical artifact. On the other hand, most design docs lie to you. They\u2019re [undead documentation](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2023/10/13/fight-undead-documentation).

He also shares insights into Redis\'s past, his thoughts on software licensing, and new technical concepts he\'s working on, such as vector sets for Redis. Below is a detailed digest of the key points from the article.\\n>\\n> After leaving Redis about 4.4 years ago, Salvatore detached himself from the project\'s code, commits, and technical management. This detachment was not born out of resentment but rather a desire to explore other areas like **writing and embedded projects**, while also spending more time with family. He describes this period as a time to \\"hack randomly\\" and explore areas like **neural networks** and **Telegram bots**. However, this \\"random hacking\\" eventually left him feeling a lack of purpose, which reignited his desire to **return to the tech world**.\\n>\\n> > \\"Hacking randomly was cool but, in the long run, my feeling was that I was lacking a real purpose, and every day I started to feel a bigger urgency to be part of the tech world again.\\"\\n>\\n> Salvatore\'s return to Redis began during a trip to **New York City** with his 12-year-old daughter. Reflecting on life changes and purpose, he decided to re-engage with Redis. This led to a conversation with the new Redis CEO, **Rowan Trollope**, where they discussed Salvatore\'s possible role. He proposed becoming a bridge between Redis Labs and the **Redis community**, creating educational materials like **demos, tutorials, and new design concepts**. An agreement was quickly reached, allowing him to rejoin Redis in a **part-time role**.\\n>\\n> > \\"I wrote him an email saying: do you think I could be back in some kind of capacity? Rowan showed interest in my proposal, and quickly we found some agreement.\\"\\n\\n2024-12-10 [What TDD is ACTUALLY Good For \u2013 Axol\'s Blog](https://theaxolot.wordpress.com/2024/12/08/what-tdd-is-actually-good-for/) { theaxolot.wordpress.com }\\n\\n> In an [earlier article](https://theaxolot.wordpress.com/2024/08/09/its-your-fault-people-dont-like-tdd/), I tore through some terrible arguments used to advocate for TDD that I see all too often (even by experienced engineers). I said in that piece that I would eventually go through what I think are better arguments for TDD, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do now.\\n\\n> **Brownfield** work also lends itself well to TDD, but less so. It depends on the complexity of the new feature, and the extendibility of the codebase. You have to use your best judgment. If it seems like a feature requires significant changes to existing modules, I\u2019d lean on traditional development. However, if you see a gentle path to implementing this new feature, you might reap more benefits with TDD.\\n>\\n> **Greenfield** development is a big no-no for TDD (at first). I don\u2019t care how confident you are in what your interfaces will be. **You\u2019re not that good**. Everything you think you know will change in the exploratory phase of a new project as you code, and you\u2019ll strain your sanity by rewriting tests over and over again.

This is not advice.\\n>\\n> What has consistently worked for me: I stopped applying for jobs, and redirected all that effort into creating and publishing open source projects that demonstrate competence in the areas of work I want. And, just as importantly, I contribute to big established open source projects in those areas too.\\n>\\n> I did not apply for my current job (started 6 months ago): they solicited me, based on my open source work. All the best jobs I\'ve had have been like that, this is the 3rd time it worked.\\n>\\n> When I\'m unemployed, I only apply for jobs I actually want, typically spending an hour each on 0-2 extremely targeted applications per week. But I treat churning out new open source stuff as my full time job until somebody notices. In addition to successfully landing me three great jobs over the past decade, this approach has made me a much much better programmer.\\n>\\n> Also, I strongly believe spending hours a day writing new code will enhance your ability to pass technical interviews much more than gamified garbage like leetcode.\\n>\\n> A huge part of making this work is not living a typical valley lifestyle: I plan my life around the median national salary for a software engineer, and when I\'m making more than that it all goes straight into my savings. In the bay, that requires living frugally (by bay standards...), but I can\'t even begin to put into words how grateful I am to past-decade-me for living like that and giving today-me the freedom to turn down the bad jobs and wait for the good ones. Obviously, I don\'t have children.\\n>\\n> I do a lot more open source than a typical programmer in the valley, but I don\'t think I\'m \\"exceptional\\" in any sense: you just have to put in the work. I do feel like I was very lucky to start my career in an extremely open-source-centric role, and in fairness that gives me a leg up here which I am probably inclined to underestimate.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Working with People\\n\\n2024-12-05 [How to Grow Professional Relationships | Tejas Kumar](https://tej.as/blog/how-to-grow-professional-relationships-tjs-model) { tej.as }\\n\\n> In my career, I\u2019ve worked with some extraordinary people while also encountering the barriers of exclusionary cliques and gatekeeping. These experiences prompted me to examine how professional relationships develop, leading to the creation of the **TJS (The Journey to Synergy) Collaboration Model**. This framework identifies seven stages that relationships can pass through, from competitive isolation to productive collaboration.\\n>\\n> For those striving to build stronger, more impactful connections\u2014whether in business, creative endeavors, or personal growth\u2014this model offers a clear lens to understand where you stand and how to move forward.\\n>\\n> ![image-20241204195601197](./2024-12-29-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241204195601197.png)\\n>\\n> **The 7 Stages of the TJS Collaboration Model: A Quick Digest**\\n>\\n> 1. **Everything is a Competition**\\n>    Relationships are marked by exclusion and a zero-sum mindset. Gatekeeping and discrimination dominate, with little to no collaboration or shared goals.\\n> 2. **Coexist**\\n>    Acknowledgment of each other\'s existence without meaningful interaction. There\u2019s mutual respect but little effort to engage, often due to differing goals, values, or personalities.\\n> 3. **Communicate**\\n>    Basic exchange of information occurs, but interactions remain shallow. Conversations may begin, but follow-through and deeper engagement are often lacking.\\n> 4. **Cooperate**\\n>    Parties work together on neutral, low-stakes tasks with transactional motives. Cooperation may lead to future opportunities but doesn\u2019t yet involve deep trust or shared investment.\\n> 5. **Coordinate**\\n>    One party adopts the other\u2019s goal and takes deliberate steps to align efforts. Trust begins to form as actions are coordinated for mutual benefit, laying the groundwork for deeper collaboration.\\n> 6. **Collaborate**\\n>    A shared project is created together, with both parties contributing equally and meaningfully. Trust, understanding, and synergy define this stage, as both sides grow from the partnership.\\n> 7. **We Are the Same**\\n>    A toxic state where boundaries dissolve, leading to unhealthy co-dependence. Individuality is lost, and relationships suffer from over-enmeshment and burnout.\\n\\n2024-12-07 \u2728 [The 6 Mistakes You\u2019re Going to Make as a New Manager \u2013 Terrible Software](https://terriblesoftware.org/2024/12/04/the-6-mistakes-youre-going-to-make-as-a-new-manager/) { terriblesoftware.org } { people management} {engineering management}\\n\\n> The right amount of engagement that you should have in your team\u2019s projects is also a tricky subject.

But what if I told you that simply reordering your columns could reduce the size of your tables and indexes by 20%? This isn\u2019t some obscure database trick \u2014 it\u2019s a direct result of how Postgres aligns data on disk.\\n>\\n> In this post, I\u2019ll explore how column alignment works in Postgres, why it matters, and how you can optimize your tables for better efficiency.

Sometimes, there is. [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/) recently shared a cool story about swapping a Python script for a custom C++ utility and saving their company a ton of cash. The gist? Their Python script, used to process a JSON file every few seconds, was hogging a full CPU core. They reworked it into a C++ program using some smart libraries like simdjson, and the difference was night and day: over ten times faster, turning a snail into a lightning bolt.\\n>\\n> Python is great for getting things up and running quickly, but when performance really matters\u2014like shaving off milliseconds in a process that runs all day\u2014C++ can be a game changer. It takes more effort to write, sure, but the payoff in speed and efficiency can be huge. Of course, it\u2019s not all rainbows; setting up dependencies and dealing with compilation takes extra time. But tools like CMake and CPM are making that part a lot less painful these days.\\n>\\n> Python\u2019s convenience makes it perfect for many tasks, but when you\u2019re pushing the limits of performance, don\u2019t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and dive into C++. It\u2019s a little extra work upfront, but when the results are this good, it\u2019s worth it. Plus, you might even impress your team with how much you can squeeze out of your hardware. Sometimes, the old-school tools are still the best ones for the job.\\n\\n> Python comes with a lot of bundled functionality whereas C++ requires you to give more thought to dependencies.

Third, we build a modern GNN, walking through each of the parts of the model, starting with historic modeling innovations in the field. We move gradually from a bare-bones implementation to a state-of-the-art GNN model. Fourth and finally, we provide a GNN playground where you can play around with a real-word task and dataset to build a stronger intuition of how each component of a GNN model contributes to the predictions it makes.\\n> ![image-20241220205509409](./2024-12-29-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241220205509409.png)\\n\\n2024-12-21 [OpenAI o3 Breakthrough High Score on ARC-AGI-Pub](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough) { arcprize.org }\\n\\n> OpenAI\'s new o3 system - trained on the ARC-AGI-1 Public Training set - has scored a breakthrough **75.7%** on the Semi-Private Evaluation set at our stated public leaderboard $10k compute limit. A high-compute (172x) o3 configuration scored **87.5%**.\\n>\\n> ARC-AGI serves as a critical benchmark for detecting such breakthroughs, highlighting generalization power in a way that saturated or less demanding benchmarks cannot. However, it is important to note that ARC-AGI is not an acid test for AGI \u2013 as we\'ve repeated dozens of times this year. It\'s a research tool designed to focus attention on the most challenging unsolved problems in AI, a role it has fulfilled well over the past five years.\\n>\\n> Passing ARC-AGI does not equate to achieving AGI, and, as a matter of fact, I don\'t think o3 is AGI yet. o3 still fails on some very easy tasks, indicating fundamental differences with human intelligence.\\n\\n2024-12-21 [Building effective agents Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) { www.anthropic.com }\\n\\n> When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all.

It\'s an amazing productivity boost. Here are a few recent examples:\\n>\\n> - **[Image Resize Quality Tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/image-resize-quality)**: This is a tool for dropping in an image and instantly seeing resized versions of that image at different JPEG qualities, each of which can be downloaded. I used to use the (much better) [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) for this, but my cut-down version is optimized for my workflow (picking the smallest JPEG version that remains legible). Notes and prompts on how I built it are available [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/26/image-resize-and-quality-comparison/).\\n>\\n> - **[django-http-debug](https://github.com/simonw/django-http-debug)**: This is an actual open-source Python package I released that was mostly written for me by Claude.

Notes on how I built it are available [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/8/django-http-debug/).\\n>\\n> - **datasette-checkbox**: This is a Datasette plugin that adds toggle checkboxes to any table with `is_` or `has_` columns. An animated demo and prompts showing how I built the initial prototype can be found [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/16/datasette-checkbox/).\\n>\\n> - **[Gemini BBox Tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox)**: This is a tool for trying out Gemini 1.5 Pro\'s ability to return bounding boxes for items it identifies. You\'ll need a Gemini API key for this one, or you can check out the demo and notes [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/).\\n>\\n> - **[Gemini Chat Tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-chat)**: This is a similar tool for trying out different Gemini models (Google released three more yesterday) with a streaming chat interface. Notes on how I built it are available [here](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-chat).\\n>\\n> I still see some people arguing that LLM-assisted development like this is a waste of time, and they spend more effort correcting mistakes in the code than if they had written it from scratch themselves.\\n>\\n> I couldn\'t disagree more.

Far from idle, he has dedicated the last five years to developing *Pull Stay*, an old-school beat-em-up game reflecting his experiences as a recluse. The protagonist, a *hikikomori* himself, battles societal judgment\u2014a theme close to Nito\u2019s heart. Using Unreal Engine, he has self-taught coding, 3D design, and storytelling to bring his vision to life.\\n>\\n> **A Creative Path Born from Setbacks**\\n> After graduating from the University of Tokyo, Nito struggled to find his footing in traditional creative fields like writing and *doujinshi* (independent manga). He shifted to game development when tools like Unreal Engine became accessible. Despite the steep learning curve and his limited English skills, Nito found purpose in creating something meaningful on his own terms.\\n>\\n> **Breaking Stereotypes and Defying Odds**\\n> Nito\u2019s life defies the typical *hikikomori* stereotype of idleness and dependence. His determination and self-taught skills showcase resilience, proving isolation doesn\u2019t equate to lack of ambition. Through *Pull Stay*, he turns personal struggles into a story that others can relate to and enjoy.\\n>\\n> **What\u2019s Next?**\\n> With *Pull Stay* nearing release on Steam, Nito hopes its success will enable him to collaborate with other creators and travel the world. If it doesn\u2019t take off, he plans to use the game as a portfolio to break into the industry. For now, his story serves as an inspiring reminder of the power of creativity and persistence.\\n>\\n> Support Nito by checking out *Pull Stay* on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1179890/Pull_Stay/) or sharing his journey with others.\\n>\\n> https://store.steampowered.com/app/1179890/Pull_Stay/\\n>\\n> ![image-20241201211045494](2024-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241201211045494.png)\\n\\n> 2024-11-30 [10% Of Engineers Should Get Fired - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Rvg5zAfT4) { www.youtube.com }\\n>\\n> ![image-20241129170004213](2024-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241129170004213.png)\\n>\\n> **What Are Ghost Engineers?**\\n> Ghost engineers are unproductive employees contributing less than 10% of a median engineer\u2019s output.

This content explores the complexities of signed and unsigned integers, common mistakes, and how to optimize performance. By understanding these nuances, you\'ll avoid common pitfalls, write more efficient code, and improve the overall robustness of your applications.\\n\\n>  **The Basics of Signed and Unsigned Integers**\\n\\n> **Representation in Memory**\\n>\\n> - **Unsigned Integers**: Simple modulo 2 representation. Overflow behavior is well-defined, which means operations that exceed the maximum value wrap around predictably.\\n> - **Signed Integers**: Historically, C++ supported various representations like one\u2019s complement and two\u2019s complement. Since C++20, two\u2019s complement is the standard. Overflow is undefined, and operations involving signed integers require careful handling to avoid unexpected behavior.\\n>\\n> **Performance Considerations**\\n> Signed integers often involve additional steps in assembly code, such as preserving the sign bit during division or right shifts. This makes operations on signed integers slower compared to their unsigned counterparts, especially in performance-critical code.\\n> For example, unsigned division by two can be replaced by a simple bit shift. Signed division, on the other hand, requires arithmetic shifts that preserve the sign bit, adding extra overhead.\\n\\n> **Best Practices for Handling Integers**\\n\\n> **Use Fixed-Width Integer Types**\\n> Explicitly use types like `int32_t`, `uint64_t`, and `size_t` when appropriate. These make your code portable and clear about the expected range of values.\\n>\\n> **Prefer Signed Types Unless Necessary**\\n> Unsigned integers should only be used when their wrapping behavior is explicitly desired. For most use cases, signed integers are safer and less prone to subtle bugs.\\n>\\n> **Leverage C++20 and C++23 Features**\\n> Modern C++ provides tools like `std::ssize` and type traits that simplify working with integers. Use these features to avoid common pitfalls and ensure correctness.\\n>\\n> **Treat Warnings as Errors**\\n> Enable strict compiler warnings (`-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Werror`) and sanitizers to catch potential issues early. Compiler tools can often detect problems like signed-unsigned mismatches before they cause runtime errors.\\n>\\n> **Avoid Overusing `auto`**\\n> While `auto` simplifies code, it can obscure type information, leading to unexpected behavior. Be explicit with integer types, especially in loops and arithmetic operations.\\n>\\n> **Author:**  Alex Dathskovsky\\n>\\n> 2024-12-07 [Demystifying CRTP in C++: What, Why, and How](https://www.cppnext.com/post/demystifying-crtp-in-c-what-why-and-how) { www.cppnext.com }\\n\\n2024-12-07 [Exposing the not-so-secret practices of the cult of DDD - Chris Klug - - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucGhUU7KuaY) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241207150005664](2024-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241207150005664.png)\\n> ![image-20241207151010087](2024-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241207151010087.png)\\n\\n> ![image-20241207151736502](2024-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241207151736502.png)\\n\\n> ![image-20241207151910484](2024-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241207151910484.png)\\n\\n2024-12-07 [Bosses Are FIRING Gen Z Workers Just Months After Hiring Them. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvCPjOxJClg) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241207154832440](2024-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241207154832440.png)\\n\\n> Source: 2024-12-07 [1 in 6 Companies Are Hesitant To Hire Recent College Graduates - Intelligent](https://www.intelligent.com/1-in-6-companies-are-hesitant-to-hire-recent-college-graduates/) { www.intelligent.com }"},{"id":"/2024/12/01/links-from-my-inbox","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/12/01/links-from-my-inbox","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2024-12-01-links-from-my-inbox.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-01-links-from-my-inbox.md","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-12-01","description":"Good Reads","date":"2024-12-01T22:27:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 1, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":41.11,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-12-01","date":"2024-12-01T22:27:00.000Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-12-15","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/15/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-11-24","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/24/links-from-my-inbox"}},"content":"## Good Reads\\n\\n2024-12-01 [Legacy Shmegacy - David Reis on Software](https://davidreiscto.substack.com/p/legacy-shmegacy?r=61pbc&triedRedirect=true&_bhlid=7b63148f971a9b1e15a02f9fc79767c0f906af48) { davidreiscto.substack.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241201132743791](2024-12-01-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241201132743791.png)\\n>\\n> People call some code legacy when they are not happy with it. Usually it simply means they did not write it, so they don\u2019t understand it and don\u2019t feel safe changing it. Sometimes it also means the code has low quality[1](https://davidreiscto.substack.com/p/legacy-shmegacy?r=61pbc&triedRedirect=true&utm_source=newsletter.programmingdigest.net&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=legacy-shmegacy&_bhlid=7b63148f971a9b1e15a02f9fc79767c0f906af48#footnote-1-151953138) or uses obsolete technologies. Interestingly, in most cases the legacy label is about the people who assign it, not the code it labels. That is, if the original authors were still around the code would not be considered legacy at all.\\n>\\n> This model allows us to deduce the factors that encourage or prevent some code from becoming legacy:\\n>\\n> 1. The longer are programmer\u2019s tenure the less code will become legacy, since authors will be around to appreciate and maintain it.\\n> 2. The more code is well architected, clear and documented the less it will become legacy, since there is a higher chance the author can transfer it to a new owner successfully.\\n> 3. The more the company uses pair programming, code reviews, and other knowledge transfer techniques, the less code will become legacy, as people other than the author will have knowledge about it.\\n> 4. The more the company grows junior engineers the less code will become legacy, since the best way to grow juniors is to hand them ownership of components.\\n> 5. The more a company uses simple standard technologies, the less likely code will become legacy, since knowledge about them will be widespread in the organization. Ironically if you define innovation as adopting new technologies, the more a team innovates the more legacy it will have. Every time it adopts a new technology, either it won\u2019t work, and the attempt will become legacy, or it will succeed, and the old systems will.\\n>\\n> The reason legacy code is so prevalent is that most teams are not good enough at all of the above to avoid it, but maybe you can be.\\n\\n\ud83e\udd52 2024-12-01 [Tech\'s $90B Ghost Engineer Problem: Stanford Study Finds 9.5...](https://socket.dev/blog/ghost-engineers) { socket.dev }\\n\\n> Beyond the economic and productivity concerns, ghost engineers pose significant security risks. Their lack of meaningful engagement can lead to a few critical issues: unreviewed or improperly tested code changes, unnoticed vulnerabilities, and outdated systems left unpatched. A disengaged engineer might also miss\u2014or deliberately ignore\u2014critical security protocols, creating potential entry points for malicious actors.\\n>\\n> When these engineers aren\'t actively involved in maintaining secure practices, they can create blind spots in a company\u2019s defense strategy, increasing the risk of breaches or compliance failures. Threat actors can exploit disengaged engineers through phishing, social engineering, or leveraging neglected updates and poorly reviewed code to infiltrate systems and compromise security. Addressing these gaps requires better oversight and collaborative practices.\\n>\\n> Before you start side-eyeing your coworkers, it\u2019s worth noting that measuring productivity in software engineering is notoriously tricky. Commit counts or hours logged are often poor indicators of true impact.

Code that compiles should be committable.\\n> 2. **Refactor Continuously**: Follow Kent Beck\'s advice: make changes easy, then make the easy changes. Frequent, small refactorings prevent complex reworks.\\n> 3. **Deploy Regularly**: Treat deployed code as the only true measure of progress. Frequent deployments ensure code reliability.\\n> 4. **Trust the Framework**: Don\u2019t test features already covered by the framework; focus on testing your unique functionality, especially with small components.\\n> 5. **Organize Independently**: If a function doesn\u2019t fit anywhere, create a new module. It\u2019s better to separate logically independent code.\\n> 6. **Write Tests First (Sometimes)**: If unsure about an API\u2019s design, start with tests to clarify requirements. TDD doesn\u2019t have to be strict\u2014write code in workable chunks.\\n> 7. **Avoid Duplication After the First Copy-Paste**: If code is duplicated, it\u2019s time for an abstraction. Consolidating multiple versions is harder than parameterizing one.\\n> 8. **Accept Design Change**: Designs inevitably get outdated. Good software development is about adapting to change, not achieving a \u201cperfect\u201d design.\\n> 9. **Classify Technical Debt**: Recognize three types of technical debt: immediate blockers, future blockers, and potential blockers. Minimize the first, address the second, and deprioritize the third.\\n> 10. **Prioritize Testability in Design**: Hard-to-test code hints at design issues. Improve testability through smaller functions or test utilities to avoid skipping tests.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd252024-11-14 [Lessons from my First Exit \xb7 mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io/lessons-from-my-first-exit/) { mtlynch.io }\\n\\n> Selling my first business was a journey filled with excitement, stress, and invaluable lessons. I want to share my experiences to help other entrepreneurs who might be considering a similar path. This post is especially relevant for small business owners and startup founders looking to navigate the complexities of a business exit.\\n>\\n> ---\\n>\\n> Quote:\\n>\\n> Used dedicated accounts for the business\\n>\\n> Part of what made TinyPilot\u2019s ownership handoff smooth was that its accounts and infrastructure were totally separate from my other business and personal accounts:\\n>\\n> - I always sent emails related to the business from my @tinypilotkvm.com email address.\\n> - I always used @tinypilotkvm.com email addresses whenever signing up for services on behalf of TinyPilot.\\n> - I kept TinyPilot\u2019s email in a dedicated Fastmail account.\\n>   - This wasn\u2019t true at the beginning. TinyPilot originally shared a Fastmail account with my other businesses, but I eventually migrated it to its own standalone Fastmail account.\\n> - I never associated my personal phone number with TinyPilot. Instead, I always used a dedicated Twilio number that forwarded to my real number.\\n> - All account credentials were in Bitwarden.\\n>\\n> After closing, handing over control was extremely straightforward. I just added the new owner to Bitwarden, and they took over from there. There were a few hiccups around 2FA codes I\u2019d forgotten to put in Bitwarden, but we worked those out quickly.\\n>\\n> ---\\n>\\n> For example, TinyPilot uses the H.264 video encoding algorithm. It\u2019s patented, so we had to get a license from the patent holder before we shipped that feature. During due diligence, we discovered that the patent license forbade me from transferring the license in an asset sale.\\n>\\n> I immediately started imagining the worst possible outcome. What if the patent holder realizes they can block the sale, and they demand I pay them $100k?

Come to think of it, I use it for lots of conference talks too. It looks like this:\\n>\\n> 1. Tell them what you\u2019re going to tell them\\n> 2. Tell them\\n> 3. Tell them what you told them\\n>\\n> What this looks like in practice is something along these lines:\\n>\\n> 1. **An intro**\\n>\\n>    What is this thing, and why should the reader ~~give af~~ be interested?\\n>\\n>    This could be a brief explanation of why I am interested in it, or why you would want to read my take on it. The key thing is you\u2019re relating to your audience here. Not everyone wants to read everything you write, and that\u2019s ok.\\n>\\n>    Let people self-select out (or in, hopefully) at this stage, but make it nice and easy. For example, if you\u2019re writing about data engineering, make it clear to the appdev crowd that they should move on as there\u2019s nothing to see here (or stick around and learn something new, but as a visitor, not the target audience).\\n>\\n> 2. **The article itself**\\n>\\n> 3. **A recap**\\n>\\n>    Make sure you don\u2019t just finish your article with a figurative mic drop\u2014tie up it nicely with a bow (a \ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffb or a \ud83c\udf80, either works).\\n>\\n>    This is where marketing would like to introduce you to the acronym CTA (Call To Action) \ud83d\ude09. As an author you can decide how or if to weave that into your narrative.\\n>\\n>    Either way, you\u2019re going to summarise what you just did and give people something to *do* with it next.

Before, we had multiple repositories, which made things like managing pull requests or syncing changes a hassle. With everything in one place now, the workflow feels smoother and simpler. It wasn\u2019t a decision we overanalyzed; it just felt like the right time to try it, and we\u2019ve been happy with the results.\\n>\\n> The main pros? First, there\u2019s less repetitive work. Instead of opening multiple pull requests across repos for a single change, now it\u2019s just one. Submodules, which were always a pain to manage, are mostly gone. Everything that needs to work together stays in sync naturally. Refactoring has also become easier because we can see the whole picture in one place, which encourages code improvements over time. Plus, being in the same repo has made us feel more connected as a team. Even small things, like seeing everyone\u2019s changes when pulling updates, help us stay in the loop without extra effort.\\n>\\n> As for cons, we honestly haven\u2019t found many. A common concern is that monorepos can get messy or slow as they grow, but for our small team, it hasn\u2019t been an issue. We kept it simple\u2014no strict rules, just \u201cdon\u2019t touch the root folder\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s been fine. It might not work the same for larger teams or projects with different dynamics, but for us, it\u2019s been a clear win.\\n\\n2024-10-14 [LogLog Games](https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/) { loglog.games }\\n\\n> I spent three years using Rust for game development, and after shipping a few games and writing over 100,000 lines of code, I\u2019m stepping away from it. Rust has some great qualities\u2014its performance is top-notch, and it often lets you refactor confidently. But for fast, iterative development, which is crucial for indie games, it just doesn\'t align well. The borrow checker and Rust\u2019s strictness often force unnecessary refactoring, slowing down the process of prototyping and testing new ideas. Tools like hot reloading, essential for quick feedback loops, are either clunky or nonexistent in Rust. And while the language excels in many technical areas, its game development ecosystem is still young, with fragmented solutions and limited support for things like GUI and dynamic workflows.\\n>\\n> For small teams like ours, the priority is delivering fun, polished games quickly. With Rust, I found myself spending more time fighting the language and its ecosystem than focusing on gameplay.

This is the essence of the **strong version of Goodhart\u2019s Law**: when a measure becomes the target, over-optimization can degrade what you originally cared about. This principle, often studied as \\"overfitting\\" in machine learning, also applies broadly to systems like education, economics, and governance.\\n>\\n> **The Problem**: When proxies (measurements or secondary goals) are optimized too well, the actual outcomes worsen. For instance, standardized testing shifts focus from genuine learning to test preparation, undermining education. Similarly, rewarding scientists for publications incentivizes trivial or false findings over meaningful progress. Overfitting to proxies creates harmful side effects, from filter bubbles in social media to inequality in capitalism. \\n> How to Fix It: Lessons from Machine Learning\\n>\\n> 1. **Better Alignment**: Make proxies closer to real goals. In machine learning, this involves better data collection. In broader systems, it means crafting laws, incentives, and norms that encourage genuine outcomes, like prioritizing long-term learning over test scores.\\n> 2. **Regularization**: Introduce penalties or costs for extreme behaviors. Just as machine learning uses mathematical constraints, systems can add friction:\\n>    - Tax extreme wealth disparities or excessive lawsuits.\\n>    - Impose costs for high-volume actions, like bulk emails or algorithmic trading.\\n>    - Penalize complexity to discourage harmful optimization.\\n> 3. **Inject Noise**: Add randomness to disrupt harmful optimization. Examples include:\\n>    - Randomized selection in competitive admissions to reduce over-preparation.\\n>    - Random trade processing delays to stabilize financial markets.\\n>    - Unpredictable testing schedules to encourage holistic studying.\\n> 4. **Early Stopping**: Halt optimization before it spirals out of control. In systems, this could mean:\\n>    - Capping time spent on decision-making relative to its stakes.\\n>    - Freezing certain information flows, like press blackouts before elections.\\n>    - Splitting monopolies to prevent market over-consolidation.\\n> 5. **Restrict or Expand Capabilities**:\\n>    - **Restrict**: Limit system capacities to prevent runaway effects, like capping campaign finances or AI training resources.\\n>    - **Expand**: In some cases, more capacity reduces trade-offs, such as developing clean energy or transparent information systems.\\n\\n```latex\\nBibTeX entry for post:\\n@misc{sohldickstein20221106,\\n\u2003 author = {Sohl-Dickstein, Jascha},\\n\u2003 title = {{ Too much efficiency makes everything worse: overfitting and the strong version of Goodhart\'s law }},\\n\u2003 howpublished = \\"\\\\url{https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/2022/11/06/strong-Goodhart.html}\\",\\n\u2003 date = {2022-11-06}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2024-09-29 [Measuring Developers\' Jobs-to-be-done - by Abi Noda](https://substack.com/@abinoda/p-148270749) { substack.com }\\n\\n> 2024-09-29 [Measuring Developers\' Jobs-to-be-done | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41636761) { news.ycombinator.com }\\n>\\n> Google used to measure how well developer tools worked by evaluating how they supported certain tasks, like \\"debugging\\" or \\"writing code.\\" However, this approach often lacked specificity that would be useful for tooling teams.

While startups thrive on speed and direct action, large organizations tend to create committees, expand scopes, and reward consensus over outcomes. These tendencies, while rooted in good intentions like collaboration and stability, can cripple innovation and efficiency when scaled excessively.\\n>\\n> **The Problem**: Bureaucrat Mode emerges as companies grow, driven by processes meant to manage complexity. However, these processes often become self-perpetuating, encouraging behaviors that prioritize internal metrics, visibility, and team expansion over meaningful results. Bureaucrats, focused on navigating processes rather than solving problems, replicate themselves by hiring others who thrive in such environments. This cycle of self-replication entrenches inefficiency and resistance to change.\\n>\\n> ![image-20241201141318646](2024-12-01-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241201141318646.png)\\n\\n2024-10-10 [How to make Product give a shit about your architecture proposal \u2013 Andy G\'s Blog](https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/2024/10/09/how-to-make-product-give-a-shit-about-your-architecture-proposal/) { gieseanw.wordpress.com }\\n\\n> When dealing with Product teams about your architecture proposal, picture yourself as a plumber who\'s trying to sell different service packages. This analogy highlights how you should present your technical proposals to Product in a way that aligns with their focus on **business value**. They\u2019re not interested in technical jargon; they want to know how your architecture decision translates into a **return on investment**. \\n>\\n> Remember that Product people are looking for results. Instead of overwhelming them with details about **OLTP** systems or **ETL processes**, you need to frame your explanation as a **negotiation** \u2014 highlighting the costs and benefits of each option, just like the plumber did with his service packages.\\n>\\n> > \\"Product doesn\u2019t give a shit about how your data is stored. Product cares about products.\\"\\n>\\n> The essence here is to avoid diving into the weeds of **indexes** or **table joins** until they understand the impact on **their budget and timeline**. When they ask, \u201cWhy is this so expensive?\u201d that\u2019s your cue to explain, in clear terms, the complexity involved in implementing things like **OLAP systems** or setting up **ETL processes**.\\n>\\n> Approach your conversation by outlining different \u201cpackages\u201d \u2014 starting with the \ud83e\udd47 **platinum package** that covers all technical needs but at a higher cost. This sets the stage for a **value discussion**, where Product sees the full picture and starts to understand the trade-offs involved.\\n>\\n> > \\"Now you can (gently) talk to them about the difference between online transaction processing systems (OLTP) and online analysis processing systems (OLAP).\\"\\n>\\n> The trick is to guide Product through a **step-by-step decision-making process**, laying out each feature as a **line item** on an invoice. This approach helps them grasp which elements of your proposal can be trimmed down or delayed to fit within their budget constraints. For example, if they can\'t afford a new **OLAP system**, offer scaled-down options, and negotiate on **scope** and **time** rather than **quality**.\\n>\\n> \ud83d\udd25 One of the most crucial points is not to compromise on **quality**. In software development, you should avoid falling into the trap of lowering standards just to meet **short-term goals**. Sacrificing quality often leads to delivering subpar products that can damage customer satisfaction in the long run. As the article states, \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, delivering something a customer actually hates, or delivering nothing at all?\u201d Maintaining a baseline of quality ensures that even with limited resources, you\'re delivering something worthwhile.\\n>\\n> If the Product team suggests cutting corners to fit the project into a **two-week sprint**, resist the temptation. The **iron triangle of software development** \u2014 time, scope, and budget \u2014 should always consider **quality** as a **non-negotiable factor**.\\n>\\n> Ultimately, you\'re helping Product to **ruthlessly prioritize** tasks to deliver the best possible outcomes within the given constraints. In these negotiations, **scope** will often be the main variable that can be adjusted to balance the budget and timeline. And when the tables turn, and it\u2019s your idea that needs their buy-in, present it in terms of **ROI** to make a compelling case.\\n>\\n> Think like a plumber: when you know the value of what you\u2019re selling, it\u2019s easier to convince others to invest in the **right solution** instead of a **quick fix**. Always push for a solution that maintains a minimum level of quality, even if it means delivering less within the same time frame.\\n\\n2024-11-03 [Get Me Out Of Data Hell \u2014 Ludicity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/get-me-out-of-data-hell/) { ludic.mataroa.blog }\\n\\n> \ud83d\udcf9 2024-11-03 [Nikhil Suresh - Skills that programmers need, to defend both their code and their careers - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlf4oXoP8qI) { www.youtube.com }\\n>\\n> This blog narrates an engineer\'s daily struggle with an overly complex and inefficient **data warehouse system**. Despite working within an ostensibly supportive team, the engineer describes their workplace as a **\\"Pain Zone,\\"** rife with convoluted processes, unchecked errors, and cultural dissonance. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the main points:\\n>\\n> The story begins with a ritual of starting the day with a senior engineering partner. Together, they embark on a shared mission to navigate the \\"Pain Zone,\\" their term for the warehouse system plagued by unnecessary complexity. The **data warehouse** in question involves copying text files from different systems, and ideally, this process should require only ten steps. However, the engineer discovers over 104 discrete operations in the architecture diagram, a staggering example of the platform\'s inefficiency.\\n>\\n> > \\"Retrieve file. Validate file. Save file. Log what you did. Those could all be one point on the diagram...That\'s ten. Why are there *a hundred and four*?\\"\\n>\\n> The engineer describes the necessity of \\"Pain Zone navigation,\\" a practice where engineers rely on **pair programming** for moral support to withstand the psychological toll of working in such an environment. The issue isn\u2019t only technical; it\u2019s deeply cultural. A culture that demands velocity while disregarding **craftsmanship** fosters an atmosphere where complexity and inefficiency go unchallenged. This attitude, the author suggests, results in the degradation of code quality, with engineers penalized for trying to refactor code.\\n>\\n> To illustrate the dysfunction further, the author recounts a routine task: checking if data from sources like Google Analytics is flowing correctly. What they find instead is garbled JSON strings dumped in the logs without logical structure, with **57,000 distinct entries** where there should be fifty. This revelation shows that for over a year, the team has been collecting \\"total nonsense\\" in the logs.\\n>\\n> > \\"We only have *two jobs*. Get the data and log that we got the data. But the logs are nonsense, so we aren\'t doing the second thing, and because the logs are nonsense *I don\'t know if we\'ve been doing the first thing.*\\"\\n>\\n> Rather than address this critical error, management insists on working with the erroneous logs to maintain \\"velocity,\\" a term often implying efficiency but, in this case, prioritizing speed over **accuracy**. The author describes the frustration of being told to parse nonsensical data instead of fixing the core issues\u2014a situation summarized by the team motto: \\"Stop asking questions, you\'re only going to hurt yourself.\\"\\n>\\n> The cultural disconnect deepens as the author tries to work with data from Twitter, only to find that log events lack an **event ID**. A supposed expert suggests using a column with ambiguous file path strings, each lacking logical identifiers, requiring complex **regular expressions** to infer events.\\n>\\n> > \\"I am expected to use regular expressions *to construct a key in my query*.\\"\\n>\\n> In yet another disheartening revelation, the author learns that the `Validated: True` log entries are merely hardcoded placeholders, not actual validation statuses. The logs fail to capture real system states, effectively undermining auditability.\\n>\\n> By the end, the author reaches a breaking point, realizing their values diverge sharply from those of the organization. This disconnect prompts them to resign, choosing to invest their time in personal projects and consulting instead. In a closing reflection, they criticize the industry for investing in trendy **tools** like Snowflake and Databricks, without hiring engineers who understand how to design simple, effective systems. \\n>\\n> > \\"I could build something superior to this with an ancient laptop, an internet connection, and spreadsheets. It would take me a month tops.\\"\\n>\\n> This piece is a critique of both **overly complex architectures** and a corporate culture that prioritizes speed over quality.

Avoiding is one strategy, and here are four others, alongside avoiding, commonly identified within conflict management models like the **Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI):**\\n>\\n>  **Avoiding**\\n>\\n> - **Behavior:** The individual sidesteps or withdraws from the conflict, neither pursuing their own concerns nor those of the other party.\\n> - **When it\'s useful:** When the conflict is trivial, emotions are too high for constructive dialogue, or more time is needed to gather information.\\n> - **Risk:** Prolonging the issue may lead to unresolved tensions or escalation.\\n>\\n> ------\\n>\\n> **Competing**\\n>\\n> - **Behavior:** The individual seeks to win the conflict by asserting their own position, often at the expense of the other party.\\n> - **When it\'s useful:** When quick, decisive action is needed (e.g., in emergencies) or in matters of principle.\\n> - **Risk:** Can damage relationships and lead to resentment if overused or applied inappropriately.\\n>\\n> ------\\n>\\n> **Accommodating**\\n>\\n> - **Behavior:** The individual prioritizes the concerns of the other party over their own, often sacrificing their own needs to maintain harmony.\\n> - **When it\'s useful:** To preserve relationships, resolve minor issues quickly, or demonstrate goodwill.\\n> - **Risk:** May lead to feelings of frustration or being undervalued if used excessively.\\n>\\n> ------\\n>\\n> **Compromising**\\n>\\n> - **Behavior:** Both parties make concessions to reach a mutually acceptable solution, often splitting the difference.\\n> - **When it\'s useful:** When a quick resolution is needed and both parties are willing to make sacrifices.\\n> - **Risk:** May result in a suboptimal solution where neither party is fully satisfied.\\n>\\n> ------\\n>\\n> **Collaborating**\\n>\\n> - **Behavior:** The individual works with the other party to find a win-win solution that fully satisfies the needs of both.\\n> - **When it\'s useful:** When the issue is important to both parties and requires creative problem-solving to achieve the best outcome.\\n> - **Risk:** Requires time and effort, which may not always be feasible in time-sensitive situations.\\n>\\n> ------\\n>\\n> Each of these strategies has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of approach often depends on the context of the conflict, the relationship between the parties, and the desired outcomes. \\n\\n\\n\\n## Wellbeing\\n\\n2024-11-03 [On Burnout, Mental Health, And Not Being Okay \u2014 Ludicity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-burnout-mental-health-and-not-being-okay/) { ludic.mataroa.blog }\\n\\n> In this deeply personal blog post, the author reflects on the mental health struggles that many people face, sharing candid experiences with burnout and severe depression.

These individuals are frustrating, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. Let me share a condensed version of my experience dealing with one and the key strategies I used to handle it.\\n>\\n> I took on a senior recruiter role with an RPO organization, filling high-level positions nationwide. Before my official role started, I was asked to temporarily support a chaotic plant with high turnover. From the start, the HR manager at the plant undermined my work, deviated from processes, and made false accusations to my boss about my performance. Despite the challenges, I stayed professional and focused on achieving results.\\n>\\n> Later, when assigned to the same plant for senior-level roles, the HR manager again tried to sabotage me. This time, I was ready. Armed with detailed documentation of every interaction, I exposed her dishonesty, which damaged her credibility. Though the plant\'s issues persisted, I didn\u2019t let her behavior derail me. Shortly after, I moved on to a better opportunity, taking invaluable lessons with me.\\n>\\n> **Lessons Learned**\\n>\\n> 1. **Document Everything:** Keep detailed records of all interactions and deliverables. These become your safety net against false accusations.\\n> 2. **Maintain Professionalism:** Stay composed and formal in your interactions. Don\u2019t stoop to their level.\\n> 3. **Set Boundaries:** Be clear about your role and responsibilities. Don\u2019t let others exploit your flexibility.\\n> 4. **Don\u2019t Internalize Their Behavior:** Their actions are a reflection of their own issues, not your worth or abilities.\\n>\\n> Corporate jerks are an unavoidable reality in most workplaces, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. Use strategy, stay professional, and remember: you\u2019re in control of your trajectory\u2014not them. When necessary, don\u2019t hesitate to move on to an environment where you can thrive.\\n\\n2024-11-23 [JavaScript in places you didn\u2019t expect - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ6fB7WClgw) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241122165048524](2024-11-24-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241122165048524.png)\\n>\\n> JavaScript is everywhere\u2014from browsers to unexpected platforms like game consoles and operating systems. Despite its quirks and criticisms, its versatility has made it indispensable. This post is for developers and tech enthusiasts curious about how JavaScript extends beyond typical web applications, influencing industries like gaming, desktop environments, and more.\\n>\\n> **JavaScript Beyond Browsers**\\n> JavaScript is not just a browser language anymore. From GNOME\u2019s desktop environment in Linux, which is almost 50% JavaScript, to Windows 11\u2019s React Native-powered start menu and recommended sections, it\u2019s embedded in operating systems. Even the PlayStation 5 relies heavily on React Native for its interface.\\n>\\n> **JavaScript in Gaming Consoles**\\n> Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Sony\u2019s PlayStation both integrate React Native into their systems. Historically, web technologies like HTML were also used (e.g., Nintendo Wii\u2019s settings menu), showing a longstanding trend of leveraging web tech for ease of development in consoles.\\n>\\n> **Gaming and UI Layers**\\n> Even major game titles like *Battlefield 1* use JavaScript and React for their UI layers, thanks to tools like MobX for state management. Developers appreciate its flexibility in managing complex UI interactions over building bespoke solutions.\\n>\\n> **Game Development: JavaScript vs. C++**\\n> *Vampire Survivors* showcases a fascinating dual approach: its browser-based JavaScript version serves as the prototype, while a team ports it to C++ for consoles. This method ensures performance optimization without sacrificing the rapid development benefits of JS.\\n>\\n> **React\u2019s Evolution and Adaptation**\\n> React Lua, originally a Roblox project, brings React\u2019s paradigms to Lua-based environments. This shows how React\u2019s influence transcends JavaScript, becoming a staple for creating UIs even in non-JS ecosystems.\\n>\\n> **Why JavaScript?**\\n> JavaScript enables faster iteration, broader developer accessibility, and reduced specialization needs. Whether it\u2019s GNOME choosing it for extensibility or game studios adopting React for UI efficiency, its ubiquity stems from practical needs.\\n\\n2024-11-18 [The Most Important API Design Guideline - No, It\'s Not That One - Jody Hagins - C++Now 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzIeQWLDSu4) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> This talk is fun, but more like theoretical and philosophical. \\n>\\n> ![image-20241117212533364](2024-11-24-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241117212533364.png)\\n> ![image-20241117223655034](2024-11-24-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241117223655034.png)\\n>\\n> \\n>\\n> ---\\n\\n\ud83d\udcdd **Property-Based Testing for Joining an Array to a String with Delimiter in C++**\\n\\n**Definition**  \\nProperty-based testing involves specifying general properties a function should satisfy for a wide range of inputs. In this example, we will test a function that joins an array of strings with a delimiter into a single string. The properties we want to validate are:\\n\\n1. The delimiter should only appear between elements, not at the start or end.\\n2. If the array has one element, the result should be the element itself without the delimiter.\\n3. An empty array should produce an empty string.\\n\\n**C++ Code Example using `rapidcheck`**\\n\\nHere\u2019s a property-based test using the `rapidcheck` library in C++ to test a `join` function that joins a vector of strings with a specified delimiter:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <rapidcheck.h>\\n#include <string>\\n#include <vector>\\n#include <sstream>\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\n// Function to join array with a delimiter\\nstd::string join(const std::vector<std::string>& elements, const std::string& delimiter) {\\n    std::ostringstream os;\\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < elements.size(); ++i) {\\n        os << elements[i];\\n        if (i != elements.size() - 1) { // Avoid trailing delimiter\\n            os << delimiter;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return os.str();\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    rc::check(\\"Joining should produce a correctly delimited string\\", [](const std::vector<std::string>& elements, const std::string& delimiter) {\\n        std::string result = join(elements, delimiter);\\n\\n        // Property 1: The delimiter should appear only between elements\\n        if (elements.size() > 1 && !delimiter.empty()) {\\n            // Split result by delimiter and check the components match the input\\n            std::vector<std::string> parts;\\n            std::string::size_type start = 0, end;\\n            while ((end = result.find(delimiter, start)) != std::string::npos) {\\n                parts.push_back(result.substr(start, end - start));\\n                start = end + delimiter.length();\\n            }\\n            parts.push_back(result.substr(start));\\n\\n            // Assert parts match elements\\n            RC_ASSERT(parts == elements);\\n        }\\n\\n        // Property 2: If there\'s only one element, the result should match that element directly\\n        if (elements.size() == 1) {\\n            RC_ASSERT(result == elements[0]);\\n        }\\n\\n        // Property 3: If the array is empty, the result should be an empty string\\n        if (elements.empty()) {\\n            RC_ASSERT(result.empty());\\n        }\\n    });\\n\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNotice that `rc::check` will run the test 100 times with different random input parameters. In case of failure, it will give the configuration and random seed info for debugging in output. \\n\\n**Explanation of Example**  \\n\\n1. **Property 1:** Ensures that if multiple elements are joined with a delimiter, the delimiter only appears between elements, not at the start or end.\\n2. **Property 2:** Checks that if the array has only one element, the function returns the element itself without any delimiter.\\n3. **Property 3:** Confirms that if the input array is empty, the output string is empty.\\n\\nThis approach guarantees that the `join` function works as expected across diverse inputs, making it more robust against edge cases such as empty arrays, single-element arrays, and unusual delimiter values.\\n\\n**Links**\\n\\n2024-11-18 [emil-e/rapidcheck: QuickCheck clone for C++ with the goal of being simple to use with as little boilerplate as possible.](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck) { github.com }\\n\\n---\\n\\n2024-11-19 [Stop Solving Problems for Your Development Team! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuCGItsAHXQ) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241118223517019](2024-11-24-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241118223517019.png)\\n>\\n> ![image-20241118223553330](2024-11-24-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241118223553330.png)\\n>\\n> ---\\n>\\n> For technical leaders, the balance between leading effectively and empowering their team can be challenging. Whether you\u2019re a software engineer managing junior developers or a product owner guiding associates, the traditional approach of \u201cjust give the answer\u201d can lead to dependency and frustration for both you and your team. This post explores the value of coaching-driven leadership\u2014a method that empowers your team to become self-sufficient, creative problem-solvers. If you\u2019re in any technical or managerial role, understanding how to guide without micromanaging is essential. Learn how adopting a coaching approach can transform your team\u2019s efficiency, autonomy, and collaboration.\\n>\\n> **The Shift from Solving Problems to Empowering People**\\n>\\n> A coaching-based leadership style redefines how leaders approach problem-solving with their teams. Instead of quickly providing answers to move tasks along, this approach encourages team members to develop the skills to tackle issues independently, ultimately creating a more resilient and capable workforce. Below are some key insights and advice on how to lead through empowerment:\\n>\\n> **Encouraging Self-Reliance Instead of Dependency**\\n>\\n>    - **Why It Matters**: When leaders constantly solve problems for others, it builds dependency. Empowering team members to find their own solutions helps reduce your stress and increases their confidence.\\n>    - **How to Do It**: Encourage team members to exhaust all possible resources and approaches before coming to you. Ask questions like, \u201cHow would you solve this if I weren\u2019t available?\u201d This encourages them to think independently.\\n>\\n> **Asking Powerful, Resourceful Questions**\\n>\\n> - **Why It Matters**: A quick solution often leads to repeated questions. When leaders ask resourceful questions, they prompt team members to analyze and solve problems on their own.\\n> - **How to Do It**: Instead of offering solutions, ask questions that challenge their thought processes. Examples include: \\n>   - \u201cWhat other approaches have you considered\u2753\ufe0f\u201d \\n>   - \u201cCan this problem be broken down into smaller tasks\u2753\ufe0f\u201d \\n>\\n>\\n> This approach builds critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\\n>\\n> **Fostering a Growth-Oriented Mindset**\\n>\\n>    - **Why It Matters**: Viewing team members as capable individuals with potential is essential. By recognizing and nurturing their strengths, leaders can help people grow into their roles more effectively.\\n>    - **How to Do It**: Reframe your thinking to see team members as resourceful and capable. Focus on their potential and ask questions that encourage them to broaden their perspectives, such as, \u201cWhat new solutions might you try if you had more resources?\u201d\\n>\\n> **Prioritizing Long-Term Gains Over Short-Term Fixes**\\n>\\n>    - **Why It Matters**: Quick answers may solve today\u2019s problem, but they build future dependency. Investing in a coaching style fosters autonomy, saving time and stress in the long run.\\n>    - **How to Do It**: Resist the urge to provide immediate solutions. Instead, encourage team members to analyze challenges thoroughly, which leads to more sustainable growth and resilience.\\n>\\n> **Practical Applications of Coaching in Technical Leadership**\\n>\\n> For leaders looking to implement these coaching principles, here are specific areas where a coaching mindset can be applied effectively:\\n>\\n>    - **Code Reviews**: Instead of dictating how code should look, ask questions about their logic and problem-solving approach. This not only ensures quality but also deepens their understanding.\\n>    - **Design and Project Reviews**: Use design critiques as opportunities to help team members articulate their design choices, fostering a culture of open dialogue and improvement.\\n>    - **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: When assisting with debugging, ask team members to consider alternative solutions or explain their thought process rather than simply fixing the problem.\\n>    - **Project Planning**: Encourage team members to independently explore solutions to potential obstacles by asking them to consider all options and resources available.\\n\\n2024-11-24 [How regexes got catastrophic - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gITmP0IWff0) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241124120931384](2024-11-24-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241124120931384.png)\\n>\\n> ### **Introduction**\\n>\\n> Regular expressions (regexes) are a foundational tool in programming, celebrated for their ability to match patterns efficiently and elegantly. However, their widespread use has exposed critical flaws in how they are implemented in most programming environments. What begins as a theoretical marvel often translates into real-world inefficiencies and vulnerabilities, leading to catastrophic outcomes like server crashes from regex denial of service (ReDoS) attacks.\\n>\\n> This post unpacks the evolution of regex algorithms, contrasts their efficiency, and explores how poor implementation choices have led to systemic issues. Whether you\'re a systems programmer, web developer, or curious about computational theory, understanding regex\'s hidden complexities will change how you approach pattern matching.\\n>\\n> **1. The Two Faces of Regex Algorithms**\\n>\\n> Regex engines typically rely on two main algorithms: the **lockstep algorithm** (also known as Thompson\'s algorithm) and **backtracking**. Here\'s how they stack up:\\n>\\n> - **Lockstep Algorithm**: This algorithm operates with predictable performance, scaling quadratically in worst-case scenarios and linearly when scaling only input size. It treats all possible paths through a regex simultaneously, avoiding exponential blowups.\\n> - **Backtracking Algorithm**: While intuitive and flexible (especially for complex features like backreferences and capturing groups), backtracking scales exponentially in the worst case. This flaw enables catastrophic backtracking, where a regex takes impractically long to resolve, even on short inputs.\\n>\\n> **2. Exponential Backtracking in Practice**\\n>\\n> Using backtracking means every possible path through a regex is explored individually. When paths multiply exponentially\u2014such as in nested structures or poorly constructed patterns\u2014the execution time balloons. For instance:\\n>\\n> - A regex engine using backtracking may take **24 ticks** to match a complex string, compared to only **18 ticks** with the lockstep algorithm.\\n>\\n> **3. Historical Decisions with Long-Lasting Impacts**\\n>\\n> The dominance of backtracking stems from historical choices made during the development of early Unix utilities:\\n>\\n> - **Ken Thompson**, the creator of regexes, implemented a lockstep-based engine in the 1960s. However, later tools like `ed` and `grep` shifted to backtracking, prioritizing simplicity and flexibility over performance.\\n>\\n> This decision, compounded by the introduction of features like backreferences and greedy quantifiers, locked most regex engines into backtracking implementations. Over time, these became embedded in standard libraries across programming languages, making lockstep a rarity.\\n>\\n> **4. Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS)**\\n>\\n> The vulnerability of backtracking manifests starkly in ReDoS attacks:\\n>\\n> - A specially crafted regex input can force an engine to explore every possible path, consuming excessive CPU cycles and halting services.\\n> - Examples include outages at **Stack Exchange (2016)** and **Cloudflare (2019)** due to poorly constructed regexes handling unexpected inputs.\\n>\\n> **5. Features That Complicate Performance**\\n>\\n> While features like **capturing groups**, **backreferences**, and **non-greedy modifiers** add functionality, they exacerbate backtracking\'s inefficiencies. For instance:\\n>\\n> - Capturing groups in backtracking engines are straightforward but introduce state-tracking complexities in lockstep implementations.\\n> - Backreferences break the theoretical constraints of regular languages, making efficient lockstep implementations infeasible.\\n>\\n> **6. Modern Solutions**\\n>\\n> Some modern regex engines, like Google\'s **RE2**, abandon backtracking altogether, focusing on performance and predictability. RE2 enforces strict adherence to regular language constraints, ensuring linear or quadratic time complexity.\\n>\\n> While sacrificing backreferences and some advanced features, engines like RE2 are critical for applications requiring robust and reliable performance, such as large-scale web services."},{"id":"/2024/11/16/links-from-my-inbox","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/16/links-from-my-inbox","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.md","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-11-16","description":"\u231a Nice watch!","date":"2024-11-16T09:07:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 16, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":39.87,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-11-16","date":"2024-11-16T09:07:00.000Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-11-24","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/24/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-10-13","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/13/links-from-my-inbox"}},"content":"## \u231a Nice watch!\\n\\nIn this blog post, I\'ll be sharing a collection of videos with concise content digests.

Below are key steps and ideas that were covered, with some outcomes noted and a few clarifications where needed. \\n>\\n> **1. Emphasizing Open Sharing for Safety and Improvement (13:52-14:36):**\\n> Fahller shared an anecdote from 1968 about Swedish military aviation, highlighting the importance of allowing team members to communicate openly, especially about mistakes or difficulties, without fear of punishment. This approach encourages honesty and helps prevent repeated mistakes.\\n>\\n> > \\"Military aviation is dangerous... let them openly, and without risk for punishment, share the problems they face while flying.\\"\\n>\\n> **Outcome:** Building a safe environment for sharing leads to a culture where team members can discuss failures without fear, helping the team learn from each experience and improve.\\n>\\n> > \ud83e\udd16 GPT: Fahller\u2019s translation suggests he views open communication as essential to growth and trust in teams, especially in high-stakes fields.\\n>\\n> **2. Encouraging Question-Asking and Knowledge Sharing (20:00):**\\n> In discussing \\"Sharing is Caring,\\" Fahller emphasized the need for team members to bring up issues or observations that might seem trivial to ensure continuous improvement. He gave examples from aviation, such as pointing out gusts of wind affecting landing, to show how small insights can contribute to collective knowledge.\\n>\\n> **Outcome:** Actively sharing observations improves understanding and may reveal underlying problems that would otherwise go unnoticed. Open communication is key to refining processes.\\n>\\n> > \ud83e\udd16 GPT: Fahller\u2019s examples reinforce the idea that even seemingly minor details should be voiced -- they may be crucial in the big picture.\\n>\\n> **3. Addressing Information Overload in Teams (37:52):**\\n> New team members often feel overwhelmed by the volume of information shared by experienced team members. Fahller suggested that newcomers should ask experienced members to slow down, provide context, and \\"paint the scene\\" so they can understand the background of the tasks.\\n>\\n> > \\"Ask them to paint the scene. What are they trying to achieve? What is it that is not working?\\"\\n>\\n> **Outcome:** When we take the time to explain context to newcomers, it helps bridge knowledge gaps and allows everyone to contribute effectively.\\n>\\n> > \ud83e\udd16 GPT: This approach builds understanding but also patience and humility in experienced team members by reminding them to make knowledge accessible.\\n>\\n> **4. Creating a Positive Review Culture (33:47):**\\n> In discussing code reviews, Fahller contrasted two styles: dismissive comments (e.g., \\"I don\u2019t understand. Rewrite!\\") vs. constructive feedback (e.g., \\"Can you explain why you chose to do it this way?\\"). He emphasized that reviews should be treated as educational opportunities rather than judgment sessions.\\n>\\n> **Outcome:** Constructive reviews foster a growth-oriented environment and allow both the reviewer and reviewee to learn. Constructive feedback motivates improvement, while dismissive comments discourage engagement.\\n>\\n> > \ud83e\udd16 GPT: A consistent, constructive review culture also promotes long-term trust and makes code quality a shared team responsibility.\\n>\\n> \\n>\\n> **5. Handling Toxicity in the Workplace (55:45):**\\n>\\n> In this segment, Bj\xf6rn Fahller tackled the issue of **toxicity** within teams and its corrosive effects on collaboration, morale, and individual well-being. He addressed specific toxic behaviors that often crop up in workplaces, describing them not as isolated incidents but as patterns that can erode trust and productivity if left unchecked. Fahller\u2019s examples of toxic behavior included:\\n>\\n> - **\\"The weekly dunce hat\\"** \u2013 Singling out someone each week as a scapegoat or object of ridicule, effectively creating an atmosphere of shame and fear.\\n> - **Blame-seeking** \u2013 Looking for someone to hold responsible for problems, rather than investigating issues constructively or as a team.\\n> - **Threats, pressure, fear, and bullying** \u2013 Using intimidation tactics to push individuals into compliance, often stifling creativity, openness, and morale.\\n> - **Ghosting** \u2013 Ignoring someone\u2019s contributions or input entirely, which Fahller noted can make people feel alienated and undervalued.\\n> - **Stealing credit** \u2013 Taking recognition for someone else\u2019s work, which not only demoralizes the actual contributor but also creates a culture of mistrust.\\n>\\n> Fahller stressed that these behaviors are not only demoralizing but actively prevent individuals from sharing ideas and asking questions openly. Such an environment can force people into silence and self-protection, hindering the team\u2019s ability to learn from mistakes and innovate. He emphasized that the first step in combating toxicity is **recognition**\u2014understanding and identifying toxic patterns when they appear.\\n>\\n> > \\"If you\'re not respected at work,\\" Fahller advised, the first course of action is to try to find **an ally**. An ally can provide a supportive voice and help validate one\'s experiences, which can be especially important if toxic behavior is widespread or normalized within the team. An ally may be able to speak up on your behalf, lend credibility to your concerns, and offer support when you\u2019re confronting challenging dynamics. This shared voice can help to bring attention to the toxicity and, ideally, drive change.\\n>\\n> However, Fahller acknowledged that finding an ally may not always be enough. If a toxic environment persists despite attempts to address it, he advised a **more decisive response**: leaving. He argued that individuals should not allow themselves to be \\"ignored, threatened or made fun of,\\" as staying in such an environment can be mentally and emotionally draining, ultimately leading to burnout and disengagement.\\n>\\n> > \\"If all else fails, go elsewhere. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be ignored, threatened or made fun of.\\" \\n>\\n> This recommendation underscores Fahller\'s stance that no one should feel compelled to remain in an unchangeable toxic environment. He suggested that people value their self-respect and mental health over job stability if the work culture is irredeemably harmful.\\n>\\n> Fahller\u2019s advice reflected a pragmatic approach to toxicity: address it internally if possible, but recognize when to prioritize personal well-being over enduring a dysfunctional work environment. While leaving a job is often a difficult decision, Fahller\'s message was clear -- don\u2019t compromise on respect and support. A healthy team environment where people feel safe and valued is essential not just for individual satisfaction but also for collective success.\\n\\n2024-11-03 [Nikhil Suresh - Skills that programmers need, to defend both their code and their careers - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlf4oXoP8qI) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241102200908952](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241102200908952.png)\\n>\\n> In his talk, **Nikhil Suresh**, the director of Hermit Tech, explores the challenges that software engineers face in the corporate world. He begins with an old animal fable about a scorpion and a frog to illustrate the dynamics between programmers and businesses.\\n>\\n> > \\"The scorpion wants to ship a web application but cannot program, so it finds a frog because frogs are incredible programmers.\\"\\n>\\n> The scorpion assures the frog that it won\'t interfere with his work. However, after some time, the scorpion hires an agile consultant and imposes new restrictions, disrupting the frog\'s workflow. This story mirrors how businesses often unknowingly hinder their own developers.\\n>\\n> Nikhil emphasizes that **most companies don\'t know much about software**, making it difficult for programmers to clearly indicate their value. He refers to **Sturgeon\'s Law**, which states that \\"90% of everything is bad,\\" highlighting the prevalence of low standards in the industry.\\n>\\n> He shares personal experiences where previous engineers lacked basic competence, such as not setting primary keys in databases or causing exorbitant costs due to misconfigured systems. These anecdotes illustrate that **businesses cannot tell the difference between good and bad programmers**, leading to competent developers being undervalued.\\n>\\n> Introducing the concepts of **profit centers** and **cost centers**, Nikhil explains that IT departments are often seen as cost centers, affecting how programmers are treated within organizations. He points out that **being better at programming isn\'t always highly valued by companies** because they may not see a direct link between technical skill and profit.\\n>\\n> To navigate these challenges, Nikhil advises developers to **never call themselves programmers**. He argues that the term doesn\'t convey meaningful information and can lead to misconceptions.\\n>\\n> > \\"If you tell someone who doesn\'t program that you\'re a programmer, their first thought is like, \'Ah, one of those expensive nerds.\'\\"\\n>\\n> He recommends reading Patrick McKenzie\'s article [\\"Don\'t Call Yourself a Programmer, and Other Career Advice\\"](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/), which offers insights into presenting oneself more effectively in the professional sphere.\\n>\\n> Nikhil encourages developers to **write about their experiences and share them online**. By doing so, they can showcase their unique ideas and differentiate themselves in the field. He believes that **your unique ideas are what differentiate you from others** and that sharing them helps in building a personal brand.\\n>\\n> He also suggests that programmers should **read outside of IT and delve into the humanities**. This broadens their perspectives and provides valuable analogies for complex ideas. Nikhil shares how his involvement in **improvised theater** and reading [\\"Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre\\" by Keith Johnstone](https://www.routledge.com/Impro-Improvisation-and-the-Theatre/Johnstone/p/book/9780878301171) helped him understand **status dynamics** in professional interactions.\\n>\\n> Understanding these dynamics allows developers to navigate job interviews and workplace relationships more effectively. Nikhil emphasizes the importance of **taking control of your career** and making decisions that enhance your value to both yourself and society.\\n>\\n> In conclusion, Nikhil urges developers to recognize that **technical skill isn\'t the main barrier to having a better career**. Factors like communication, strategic thinking, and understanding corporate dynamics play crucial roles. By focusing on these areas, developers can transform their passion into something that has greater value for both themselves and the broader community.\\n\\n2024-11-02 [Get old, go slow, write code! - Tobias Modig - NDC Oslo 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCQhiibI5M) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241116004657646](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241116004657646.png)\\n>\\n> \ud83d\udcdd Sustainable Software Development Careers: Aging, Quality, and Longevity in Tech\\n>\\n> **Introduction**  \\n> In the fast-evolving world of software development, many professionals feel the pressure to stay young, move fast, and keep up with new trends. But does speed really equal success in this field? This post is for experienced developers, tech managers, and anyone considering a long-term career in software. We\'ll explore why sustainability in development\u2014focusing on quality, experience, and career longevity\u2014matters and how you can embrace aging as an asset, not a setback.  \\n>\\n> **Why You Should Care**  \\n> The tech industry often promotes rapid career progression and cutting-edge skills over stability and endurance. However, valuing experience, avoiding burnout, and emphasizing quality over speed are essential for creating durable, impactful software and ensuring personal career satisfaction. \\n>\\n> **Embracing Aging as a Developer**  \\n>\\n>    Many developers worry about becoming irrelevant as they age, yet experience can be a strength. Research shows the average age of developers is among the lowest across professional fields, meaning many leave the field early. However, experience contributes to problem-solving, architectural insights, and higher quality standards. Older developers often provide unique perspectives that younger professionals may lack, particularly in maintaining and improving code quality.\\n>\\n> **Slowing Down for Quality**  \\n>\\n>    Too many developers face intense pressure to deliver quickly, often sacrificing quality. This results in technical debt and rushed code that becomes difficult to maintain. The speaker argues that development is a marathon, not a sprint. Slowing down and building sustainable software creates long-term benefits, even if it appears slower at first. By prioritizing thoughtful coding and taking the time to address technical debt, developers can create resilient, maintainable systems.\\n>\\n> **Challenges with Traditional Career Progression**  \\n>\\n>    Many companies push experienced developers into management roles, which can leave skilled coders dissatisfied and underutilized. Known as the Peter Principle, this approach often results in skilled developers becoming ineffective managers. For those passionate about coding, staying in development roles\u2014rather than climbing the corporate ladder\u2014can offer fulfillment, especially if companies recognize and reward this choice.\\n>\\n> **Common Reasons Developers Leave the Field**  \\n>\\n>    Major reasons include burnout, shifting to roles with higher prestige, and losing the spark for coding. Additionally, aging can lead to insecurities about keeping up. To combat these trends, developers should prioritize work-life balance, take time to learn, and avoid the mindset that career progression has to mean management.\\n>\\n> **Practical Ways to Build a Sustainable Career**  \\n>\\n>    - **Commit to Continuous Learning**: Attend conferences, read, and experiment with code to stay current.  \\n>    - **Focus on Quality over Speed**: Embrace practices like regular code reviews, refactoring, and retrospectives to build robust systems.  \\n>    - **Build Team Trust and Psychological Safety**: A supportive environment enhances productivity, allowing team members to grow together.\\n>    - **Incorporate Slack Time**: Give yourself unstructured time to think, learn, and work creatively, helping avoid burnout and stagnation.\\n>\\n> **Let Experience Be Your Advantage**  \\n>\\n>    Staying relevant as a developer means focusing on the quality of your contributions, leveraging your experience to guide teams, and advocating for sustainable practices that benefit the entire organization. By valuing experience, resisting the rush, and maintaining passion, you can contribute meaningfully to tech at any age.\\n>\\n> **Quotes**\\n>\\n> >  \\"Getting old in software development is not a liability\u2014it\'s an asset. Make those gray hairs your biggest advantage and let your experience shine through in quality code.\\"\\n>\\n> > \\"Software development is not a sprint; it\'s a marathon. We need to slow down, find a sustainable pace, and stop rushing to deliver at the expense of quality.\\"\\n>\\n> > \\"Don\'t let your career be dictated by the Peter Principle\u2014just because you\'re a great developer doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll enjoy management. Stay with your passion if it\u2019s coding.\\"\\n>\\n> > \\"Poor quality code isn\u2019t just a short-term fix; it\u2019s a long-term burden. Building things right the first time is the fastest way to long-term success.\\"\\n>\\n> > \\"There\u2019s no need to be Usain Bolt in development; be more like a marathon runner.

In this insightful lecture, a distinguished writing instructor from the University of Chicago\'s Writing Program emphasizes that effective writing requires understanding your audience, establishing relevance, and creating a compelling narrative. This article captures the speaker\u2019s key advice on improving writing by focusing on purpose, value, and the reader\'s needs.\\n>\\n> ------\\n>\\n> 1. **Focus on Value, Not Originality**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: The speaker challenges the idea that writing must always present something \\"new\\" or \\"original.\\" Instead, writers should prioritize creating valuable content that resonates with their audience.\\n> - **Application**: Rather than striving for originality alone, focus on producing content that addresses the reader\u2019s concerns or questions. A piece of writing is valuable if it enriches the reader\u2019s understanding or helps solve a problem they care about.\\n>\\n> 2. **Define the Problem Clearly**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: To make a piece of writing compelling, start by establishing a problem that is relevant to your audience. A well-defined problem creates a sense of instability or inconsistency, which engages readers and positions the writer as a problem-solver.\\n> - **Application**: Use contrasting language to highlight instability\u2014words like \\"but,\\" \\"however,\\" and \\"although\\" signal unresolved issues. This approach shifts the reader\u2019s focus to the problem at hand, making them more receptive to the writer\'s proposed solution.\\n>\\n> 3. **Understand and Address Your Reader\u2019s Needs**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: A writer\u2019s task is to understand the specific needs and concerns of their reading community. This involves identifying problems that resonate with them and framing your thesis or solution in a way that is relevant to their lives or work.\\n> - **Application**: In academic and professional settings, locate problems in real-world contexts. Rather than presenting background information, articulate a challenge or inconsistency that is specific to the reader\u2019s field or interests, making your argument compelling and directly relevant.\\n>\\n> 4. **Use the Language of Costs and Benefits**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: Writers should make it clear how the identified problem affects the reader directly. Frame issues in terms of \\"costs\\" and \\"benefits\\" to emphasize why addressing the problem is essential.\\n> - **Application**: Highlight the impact of ignoring the problem versus the benefits of solving it. This approach reinforces the relevance of your writing by aligning it with the reader\u2019s motivations and concerns.\\n>\\n> 5. **Beware of the \\"Gap\\" Approach**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: Avoid using the concept of a \\"knowledge gap\\" as the sole justification for writing on a topic. While identifying gaps in research can work, it often lacks the urgency or impact required to engage readers fully.\\n> - **Application**: Rather than just pointing out missing information, emphasize the practical implications of filling that gap. Explain how the lack of certain knowledge creates instability or inconsistency in the field, making the need for your insights more compelling.\\n>\\n> 6. **Adopt a Community-Centric Perspective**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: Tailor your writing to the specific communities who will read it. Different communities (e.g., narrative historians vs. sociologists) have distinct approaches to problems and value different types of arguments.\\n> - **Application**: Define and understand the community of readers your work is meant to serve. Address their concerns directly and frame your argument in terms that align with their unique perspectives and values.\\n>\\n> 7. **Learn from Published Articles**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: Published work often contains subtle rhetorical cues about what resonates with readers in a specific field. Study these articles to understand the language, structure, and approach that successful writers use.\\n> - **Application**: Identify patterns in the language of published work within your target field. For instance, if a journal commonly uses cost-benefit language, incorporate it into your writing to align with reader expectations.\\n>\\n> 8. **Emphasize Function Over Form**\\n>\\n> - **Advice**: Writing should serve a clear function beyond just following formal rules. Effective writing achieves its purpose by clearly communicating the problem and its significance to readers.\\n> - **Application**: Instead of focusing solely on rules or formalities, think about what your writing needs to accomplish for your audience. Make sure that every section and statement reinforces your overall argument and purpose.\\n\\n2024-11-08 [Developer Joy \u2013 How great teams get s%*t done - Sven Peters - NDC Oslo 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqjyPl5ytZc) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241107182436885](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241107182436885.png)\\n>\\n> ![image-20241107182600363](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241107182600363.png)\\n>\\n>\\n> \\n> In today\u2019s fast-evolving tech landscape, \u201cDeveloper Joy\u201d is emerging as a crucial focus for engineering teams striving to deliver high-quality, innovative software. For those in software engineering or tech management, this concept brings a fresh perspective, shifting away from traditional productivity metrics and emphasizing a developer\u2019s experience, satisfaction, and creativity. By focusing on Developer Joy, teams can foster an environment where developers not only perform optimally but also find deep satisfaction in their craft. This shift is more than just a trend; it\u2019s a rethinking of how we define and sustain productivity in a complex, creative field like software development.\\n>\\n> **The Problem with Traditional Productivity Metrics**\\n>\\n>    Traditional productivity measures, like lines of code or tasks completed, often fail to capture a developer\'s real impact. Software development, unlike factory work, requires creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability\u2014traits that are poorly reflected in industrial-era metrics. Instead of simply measuring output, focusing on Developer Joy acknowledges the unique, non-linear nature of coding and innovation. \\n>\\n> **Developer Joy: A New Approach to Productivity**\\n>\\n>    Developer Joy isn\'t about doing more in less time; it\u2019s about creating an environment where developers thrive. When developers are joyful, they produce better code, collaborate more effectively, and sustain their motivation over time. Atlassian\u2019s approach to Developer Joy incorporates several elements to support this environment:\\n>\\n>    - **High-quality Code:** Developers enjoy working with well-structured, maintainable code.\\n>    - **Progressive Workflows:** Fast, friction-free pipelines allow developers to take an idea from concept to deployment quickly.\\n>    - **Customer Impact:** When developers know they\u2019re making a meaningful difference for users, they feel a greater sense of pride and accomplishment.\\n>\\n>  **Tools and Processes to Foster Developer Joy**\\n>\\n>    To enable Developer Joy, teams at Atlassian have implemented practical solutions:\\n>\\n>    - **Constructive Code Reviews:** By establishing a code review culture where feedback is respectful and constructive, teams can maintain high standards without discouraging or frustrating developers. Guidelines like assuming competence, offering clear reasoning, and avoiding dismissive comments make reviews both productive and uplifting.\\n>\\n>    - **Flaky Test Detection:** The Confluence team developed an internal tool that identifies \u201cflaky tests\u201d (tests that fail intermittently) to save developers from unnecessary debugging. This tool boosts productivity by automating the detection and removal of unreliable tests.\\n>\\n>    - **The Punit Bot for Review Notifications:** Timely code reviews are essential for maintaining team flow. The Punit Bot automatically notifies team members when their input is needed on pull requests, cutting down waiting times and keeping development on track.\\n>\\n> **Cross-Functional, Autonomous Teams**\\n>\\n>    Teams need the freedom to work independently while staying aligned on goals. By embedding key functions within each team (like design, QA, and operations), Atlassian ensures that teams can progress without external dependencies. This \u201cstack interchange\u201d model allows each team to flow without bottlenecks.\\n>\\n> **Quality Assistance over Quality Assurance**\\n>\\n>    Developers at Atlassian don\u2019t rely solely on QA engineers to validate code. Instead, they partner with QA in the planning stage, gaining insights on testing best practices and writing their own test cases. This approach, called \u201cQuality Assistance,\u201d keeps quality embedded throughout the process and gives developers more control over the software they release.\\n>\\n>  **Collaborating with Product Teams**\\n>\\n>    Effective collaboration with product teams is crucial. Atlassian integrates developers into the full product lifecycle\u2014from understanding the problem to assessing impact after release. This holistic involvement reduces miscommunication, enables rapid adjustments based on early feedback, and fosters a sense of ownership and pride in the end product.\\n>\\n> **The Developer Joy Survey: Measuring What Matters**\\n>\\n>    To ensure Developer Joy remains high, Atlassian conducts regular \u201cDeveloper Joy Surveys,\u201d asking developers about their satisfaction in areas such as tool access, wait times, autonomy, and overall work satisfaction. By measuring both satisfaction and importance, teams identify and address specific challenges to ensure joy remains a central part of their development culture.\\n>\\n> ---\\n>\\n> **Notable Quotes and Jokes**\\n>\\n> - \u201cDeveloper Joy is about creating an environment where developers thrive, not just survive.\u201d\\n> - \u201cIf you can\u2019t measure Developer Joy, you\u2019re probably measuring the wrong thing.\u201d\\n> - \u201cCode reviews should be about learning, not earning jerk points.\u201d\\n> - \u201cProductivity isn\u2019t about lines of code; it\u2019s about finding joy in the code you write.\u201d\\n\\n2024-11-09 [Herding cats: lessons from 15 years of managing engineers at Microsoft - Kevin Pilch - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg8Q8jR6tX4) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241109130107457](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241109130107457.png)\\n\\n> ![image-20241109130841936](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241109130841936.png)\\n\\n>  ***Introduction***\\n>  **Purpose and Relevance**  \\n>  This talk explores the nuances of managing software engineering teams. It\u2019s particularly relevant for new or seasoned managers, especially those transitioning from technical roles to leadership. The speaker, **Kevin Pilch**, leverages his extensive experience managing engineering teams at Microsoft to provide insights into effective management strategies, challenges, and actionable advice.\\n>\\n>  **Target Audience**  \\n>  Ideal for **current and aspiring managers** of software engineering teams, as well as individual contributors considering a management path.\\n>\\n>  ***Main Content***\\n>\\n>  **Coaching vs. Teaching**  \\n>  The emphasis here is on **coaching** engineers rather than simply teaching them. Coaching means asking questions that encourage team members to find solutions independently, fostering growth and engagement. By using the **\\"ask solution\\" quadrant approach**, managers can guide engineers toward problem-solving rather than directly offering answers, which enhances ownership and accountability.\\n>\\n>  **Focus on Top Performers**  \\n>  Spend more time supporting **top performers** instead of focusing solely on underperformers. The impact of losing a high performer is significant\u2014they are often **highly sought after** and can easily find other opportunities. Retaining skilled contributors by offering continuous support and new challenges is essential.\\n>\\n>  **Importance of Self-Evaluation**  \\n>  The **self-evaluation process** is a valuable opportunity for engineers to reflect on their career paths, skill gaps, and accomplishments. By encouraging engineers to **take ownership** of self-assessments, managers promote introspection and personal growth, while also creating useful documentation for future managers and potential promotions.\\n>\\n>  **Providing Clear Feedback**  \\n>  When giving performance feedback, it\u2019s essential to **avoid \u201cweasel words\u201d** and sugarcoating, which soften the message and create misunderstandings. Use specific language that correlates to performance expectations\u2014such as **\u201clower than expected impact\u201d**\u2014to ensure feedback is **clear, actionable**, and direct.\\n>\\n>  **Encouraging Constructive Failure**  \\n>  Allow team members to experience **failure on controlled projects** to enhance learning and resilience. This approach lets engineers learn from mistakes without jeopardizing critical objectives. By creating \u201csafe-to-fail\u201d environments, managers can frame certain projects as experiments and define success metrics upfront, avoiding sunk cost fallacies and confirmation biases.\\n>\\n>  **Task Assignment Using the ABC Framework**  \\n>  Assign tasks based on **complexity relative to each team member\u2019s skill level**. Above-level tasks serve as **stretch assignments** to promote growth, current-level tasks reinforce skills, and below-level tasks include routine but necessary responsibilities that everyone shares. Balancing these types keeps team members **challenged and engaged** while ensuring essential work is completed.\\n>\\n>  **Motivating Different Personality Types**  \\n>  The **SCARF model**\u2014Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness\u2014can help recognize **diverse motivators** across the team. Managers should tailor interactions to each team member\u2019s unique motivators, fostering a supportive environment that avoids triggering negative responses.\\n\\n2024-11-12 [Success On Your Own Terms - Todd Gardner - CPH DevFest 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRXcxTMH7X4) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241111212449932](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241111212449932.png)\\n>\\n> **Defining Success on My Own Terms: Lessons from My Journey in Tech**\\n>\\n> For over 25 years, I\'ve navigated the ever-changing landscape of the tech industry.

If you\'re a developer, entrepreneur, or someone contemplating your own path in tech, perhaps my experiences can offer some insights.\\n>\\n> **The Evolution of Success**\\n>\\n> My definition of success has shifted throughout my career. It began with a desire for prestige, evolved into a quest for independence, and later transformed into valuing time above all else. I\'ve come to realize that success isn\'t a fixed destination but a moving target that changes as we grow.\\n>\\n> *\\"The definition of success for me has shifted throughout my career. It used to just mean prestige. Then it meant independence, and then it meant time, and it\'s probably going to change again.\\"*\\n>\\n> **Building Request Metrics**\\n>\\n> I founded Request Metrics with the goal of addressing a critical problem: web performance. Initially, we focused on client-side observability, aiming to help developers monitor their websites and applications. However, we soon discovered that web performance is a complex issue, laden with constantly changing metrics and definitions.\\n>\\n> **The Challenge of Web Performance**\\n>\\n> Developers often struggle with understanding and improving web performance. The industry\'s metrics seem to continually shift, making it hard to pin down what \\"fast\\" truly means. This confusion was costing businesses real money, especially as user expectations for speed grew.\\n>\\n> *\\"It turns out developers don\'t know how to make things fast, and it\'s a problem that got a lot more important recently because of a thing Google did called the Core Web Vitals.\\"*\\n>\\n> **Google\'s Core Web Vitals**\\n>\\n> The game changed when Google introduced Core Web Vitals\u2014a set of metrics that directly impact search rankings. Suddenly, web performance wasn\'t just a technical concern but a business-critical issue. Companies that relied on SEO for visibility faced tangible consequences if their websites didn\'t meet these new standards.\\n>\\n> *\\"Google said, \'This is how fast you need to be,\' and if you don\'t, you\'re going to lose page rank. So now this suddenly got way more... now there is a cost to do this. If you are an e-commerce store or you are a content publisher... you care a whole lot about the Core Web Vitals; you care about performance.\\"*\\n>\\n> **Pivoting to Solve Real Problems**\\n>\\n> Recognizing this shift, we pivoted Request Metrics to focus on helping businesses understand and improve their Core Web Vitals. We developed tools that provide clear, actionable insights into performance issues. By doing so, we addressed a real pain point, offering solutions that companies were willing to invest in to protect their search rankings and user experience.\\n>\\n> *\\"We started building a new thing that was all about the Core Web Vitals. It was like, \'This is the problem that we need to solve.\' Businesses that depend on their SEO... it\'s not clear when they\'re about to lose their SEO ranking because of performance issues. So let\'s focus on that.\\"*\\n>\\n> **Lessons Learned**\\n>\\n> Throughout this journey, I\'ve learned several key lessons.\\n>\\n> Time is precious. Life is unpredictable, and opportunities can be fleeting. It\'s crucial to focus on what truly matters and act promptly.\\n>\\n> *\\"First, you don\'t have as much time as you think. This story can end for any one of us tomorrow... It might all be over tomorrow, so do what you think is important.\\"*\\n>\\n> Embracing uncertainty is essential. Feeling unprepared is natural. Many successful endeavors begin without a clear roadmap. Confidence often comes from taking action and learning along the way.\\n>\\n> *\\"Don\'t worry if you don\'t know, if you don\'t feel confident in what you\'re doing. None of us know what we\'re doing when we start... They just started and figured it out as they went. You can do that too.\\"*\\n>\\n> Building relationships is vital. Success isn\'t achieved in isolation. Cultivating strong relationships and working collaboratively can open doors you never knew existed.\\n>\\n> *\\"Remember, no matter what you do or what you want out of life, you need to build relationships with people around you. Don\'t isolate yourself and think you can solve it all by yourself. Those relationships... are going to pay huge dividends that you could never imagine.\\"*\\n>\\n> Solving real problems should be a priority. Focus on creating solutions that address genuine needs. If your product solves a real problem, people are more likely to value and pay for it.\\n>\\n> *\\"Be sure to build products that actually solve real problems that cost people money. Otherwise, you might find yourself building something really cool that nobody is ever going to pay you for.\\"*\\n>\\n> Adapting and evolving are necessary. Be prepared to change course. Flexibility is key to staying relevant and achieving long-term fulfillment.\\n>\\n> *\\"We found through this we found a problem that was costing money to real people, and this is the path that we\'re on right now... because now we\'re solving a problem for people that... it\'s cheaper to pay us to solve the problem than to deal with the risks.\\"*\\n>\\n> Taking risks and shipping early can lead to growth. Don\'t wait for perfection. Launching early allows you to gather feedback and iterate, which is more valuable than holding back out of fear.\\n>\\n> *\\"If you\'re going to build something successful and durable... you\'re going to need people to help. And be sure to build products that actually solve real problems... But you won\'t hit them unless you ship something, and if you\'re not embarrassed of it, you\'re waiting too long. Just throw something together and get it out there and see if anybody cares.\\"*\\n>\\n> **Moving Forward**\\n>\\n> As I continue on this path, I understand that my definition of success will keep evolving. What\'s important is to remain true to oneself, prioritize meaningful work, and leverage relationships to create lasting impact.\\n\\n2024-11-14 [Windows: Under the Covers - From Hello World to Kernel Mode by a Windows Developer - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf-dwrwVcMs) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241116005812334](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241116005812334.png)\\n>\\n> For programmers and tech enthusiasts, \\"Hello World\\" is a rite of passage, a first step in coding. But behind the simplicity of printing \\"Hello World\\" on the screen, there lies a deeply intricate process within the Windows operating system. This article uncovers the fascinating journey that a simple `printf` command in C takes, from the initial code execution to the text\u2019s appearance on the screen, traversing multiple layers of software and hardware. If you\'re curious about what happens behind the scenes of an OS or want a glimpse into the hidden magic of programming, this guide is for you.\\n>\\n> 1. **Starting Point: Writing `Hello World` in C**\\n>    - The classic C code `printf(\\"Hello, World!\\");` initiates the journey. In this line, the `printf` function doesn\'t directly display text. Instead, it prepares data for output, setting off a series of calls to the OS to manage the display of the text.\\n>\\n> 2. **Processing `printf`: User Mode to Kernel Mode**\\n>    - The runtime library processes `printf`, identifying format specifiers and preparing raw text to be sent to the output. This initiates a function call, like `WriteFile` or `WriteConsole`, which interacts with Windows\u2019 Win32 API\u2014a vast interface linking programs to system resources.\\n>    - **Kernel32.dll**: Despite its name, `Kernel32.dll` operates in user mode, providing system access without directly tapping into the kernel. Named for historical reasons, it bridges functions requiring OS kernel resources by keeping security intact.\\n>\\n> 3. **Transitioning with System Calls**\\n>    - System calls serve as gates from user mode (where applications operate) to kernel mode (where core OS processes run). Here, Windows uses the System Descriptor Table and system calls like `int 2E` to cross into kernel mode securely, ensuring only validated programs access system resources.\\n>\\n> 4. **Windows Kernel Processing with `ntoskrnl.exe`**\\n>    - After the system call, `ntoskrnl.exe` checks permissions and validates parameters to ensure secure execution. This step guarantees the program isn\u2019t making unauthorized access attempts, which fortifies Windows against possible exploits.\\n>\\n> 5. **Console Management through `csrss.exe`**\\n>    - The Client Server Runtime Subsystem (`csrss.exe`) manages console windows in user mode. `csrss` updates the display buffer, which holds the text data ready for rendering. It keeps a two-dimensional array of characters, handling all aspects like color, intensity, and style to maintain the console window\u2019s appearance.\\n>\\n> 6. **Rendering Text with Graphics Device Interface (GDI)**\\n>    - GDI takes over for text rendering within the console, providing essential drawing properties like font and color. The console then relies on the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), which bridges communication between software and the graphics hardware.\\n>\\n> 7. **The GPU and Frame Buffer**\\n>    - The GPU receives the data, rendering the text by processing pixel-by-pixel instructions into the frame buffer. This buffer, a region of memory storing display data, holds the image of \\"Hello World\\" that will appear on screen. The GPU then sends this image to the display via HDMI or another interface.\\n>\\n> 8. **From Monitor to Visual Cortex**\\n>    - The display presents the text through LED pixels, and from there, light travels to the viewer\u2019s eyes. Visual processing occurs in the brain\'s visual cortex, ultimately registering \\"Hello World\\" in the viewer\'s consciousness\u2014a culmination of hardware, software, and human biology.\\n>\\n> **Notable Quotes and Jokes from Dave Plummer:**\\n>\\n> - *\\"Imagine the simplest Windows program you could write...but do you know how the magic happens?\\"*\\n> - *\\"Our journey begins in userland within the heart of your C runtime library.\\"*\\n> - *\\"Calling `printf` is like sending a messenger on a long cross-country journey from high-level code to low-level bits and back again.\\"*\\n> - *\\"When \'Hello World\' pops up on the screen, you\u2019re witnessing the endpoint of a complex, coordinated process...\\"*\\n\\n2024-11-14 [In Prompts We Trust - Jiaranai Keatnuxsuo - CPH DevFest 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUkrC38v9Rg) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241116010954387](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241116010954387.png)\\n> For those diving into AI applications, especially prompt engineering with generative AI, understanding trust-building and prompt precision is key to leveraging AI effectively. If you\u2019re an AI practitioner, developer, or someone interested in optimizing how language models generate outputs, this guide explores techniques to achieve trustworthy and accurate AI responses. By improving prompt engineering skills, you\u2019ll better navigate the complexities of AI interactions and make your AI applications more reliable, relevant, and valuable.\\n>\\n> \\n>\\n> **Core Techniques and Strategies in Prompt Engineering**\\n>\\n> When working with generative AI, the goal is to create prompts that elicit useful, accurate, and relevant responses. This requires understanding both the technical aspects of prompt engineering and the psychological aspects of trust. Here are key techniques for mastering this process:\\n>\\n> **The Importance of Trust in AI Outputs**\\n>\\n> Trust plays a central role in whether users accept or reject AI-generated outputs. As the speaker noted, \u201cTrust is the bridge between the known and the unknown.\u201d For AI to be effective, especially in high-stakes fields like medicine or government applications, users must feel confident in the system\u2019s reliability and fairness. Factors that foster this trust include:\\n>\\n>    - **Accuracy**: Ensuring the output is based on factual information and up-to-date sources.\\n>    - **Reliability**: Confirming that outputs remain consistent across different scenarios.\\n>    - **Personalization**: Tailoring responses to individual needs and contexts.\\n>    - **Ethics**: Adhering to ethical guidelines, avoiding bias, and maintaining cultural sensitivity.\\n>\\n> **Precision in Prompt Engineering: Essential Techniques**\\n>\\n> To build trust, prompts need to be structured in a way that maximizes clarity and minimizes ambiguity. Key methods include:\\n>\\n>    - **Role Prompting**: Assigning specific roles, such as \u201cact as a coding assistant,\u201d guides the model in responding within a particular expertise framework. As the speaker shared, \u201cRole prompting is really good in terms of getting it to go find all those billions of web pages it was trained on.\u201d\\n>\\n>    - **Chain of Thought Prompting**: By instructing the model to provide step-by-step reasoning, this method helps in breaking down complex queries and reducing errors. For example, prompting the model to explain each step in a calculation avoids \u201cerror piling,\u201d where initial mistakes skew subsequent responses.\\n>\\n>    - **System Messages**: Used primarily by developers, system messages define overarching rules or tones for the AI. These instructions are hidden from the end-user but ensure the model stays consistent, ethical, and aligned with specific guidelines.\\n>\\n> **Handling AI\u2019s Limitations: Mitigating Hallucinations and Bias**\\n>\\n> \u201cHallucination\u201d refers to instances where AI generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information. The speaker explained, \u201cWe all think that hallucination is a bug; it\u2019s actually not a bug\u2014it\u2019s a feature, depending on what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d For applications where accuracy is crucial, employing techniques like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** helps ground AI responses by referencing reliable external sources.\\n>\\n> **Optimizing Prompt Parameters for Desired Outputs**\\n>\\n> Adjusting parameters such as **temperature, frequency penalties,** and **presence penalties** can enhance the creativity or precision of AI responses. For example, higher temperatures lead to more creative, varied outputs, while lower settings make responses more predictable and factual. As the speaker noted, \u201cEvery word in a prompt matters,\u201d so these settings allow for fine-tuning responses to suit specific needs.\\n>\\n> \\n>\\n> **Recap & Call to Action**\\n>\\n> Effective prompt engineering isn\u2019t just about crafting prompts\u2014it\u2019s about understanding trust and precision. Key strategies include role prompting, step-by-step guidance, and adjusting AI parameters to manage reliability and relevance. Remember, the goal is to enhance user trust by ensuring outputs are clear, relevant, and ethically sound. Try implementing these techniques in your next AI project to see how they impact the quality and trustworthiness of your results. \\n\\n2024-11-14 [Gwern Branwen - How an Anonymous Researcher Predicted AI\'s Trajectory](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/gwern-branwen) { www.dwarkeshpatel.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241114141855768](2024-11-16-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241114141855768.png)\\n>\\n> Gwern is a pseudonymous researcher and writer.

For C++ developers, unit testing offers a rigorous approach to quality control, catching bugs early and enhancing code reliability. This article covers the essentials of unit testing in C++, focusing on why and how to apply it effectively in your projects. Whether you\u2019re an experienced developer or a newcomer in C++, this guide will clarify best practices and introduce powerful frameworks to streamline your testing efforts.\\n>\\n> **Core Concepts and Challenges in Unit Testing**\\n>\\n> **Understanding Unit Testing in C++**  \\n> Unit testing verifies the smallest unit of code, usually a function, to confirm it works as intended. Over the past decade, it has become essential for software development projects, preventing critical bugs from reaching production and reducing the risk of project failures. While the concept is straightforward, implementing effective unit tests in C++ brings unique challenges, such as determining what to test and choosing the right framework to manage tests efficiently.\\n>\\n> **Addressing Key Challenges**  \\n>\\n> 1. **Framework Selection**: C++ offers various testing frameworks like Catch2, which simplifies setting up unit tests and provides structured error reporting.\\n> 2. **Consistent Definitions**: Defining what qualifies as a unit test varies across the industry. This inconsistency can complicate efforts to standardize testing practices.\\n> 3. **Testing Complexity**: Many projects require extensive, comprehensive testing to cover complex logic, edge cases, and integration points without compromising performance.\\n>\\n> **Implementing Unit Tests Effectively**\\n>\\n> **Using a Framework**  \\n> Frameworks like Catch2 streamline test organization, allowing developers to structure tests in isolated, repeatable units. They provide clear output, automated reporting, and enable testing of all components, highlighting each failure without halting the entire test process. The framework choice is critical in ensuring that tests are not only functional but also maintainable and understandable.\\n>\\n> **Structure and Placement of Tests**  \\n> The closer tests are to the code they evaluate, the easier they are to maintain. Best practices recommend keeping test files within the same project structure, allowing for easy updates and reducing the chance of disconnects between tests and the code they assess.\\n>\\n> **Scientific Principles in Unit Testing**\\n>\\n> Effective unit testing is analogous to scientific experimentation. Each test is an \u201cexperiment\u201d designed to verify code behavior by testing specific inputs and expected outcomes. Emphasizing **falsifiability** ensures that tests are objective and replicable, providing clear indications of any issues. Core scientific principles in testing include:\\n>\\n> 1. **Repeatability and Replicability**: Tests should yield consistent results on repeated runs.\\n> 2. **Precision and Accuracy**: Tests should be specific and unambiguous, with clear indications of success or failure.\\n> 3. **Thorough Coverage**: Effective tests cover all code paths and edge cases, ensuring all possible scenarios are addressed.\\n>\\n> **Valid and Invalid Tests: Ensuring Accuracy**\\n>\\n> Accurate tests provide clear insights into code functionality. Avoid using the code\u2019s output as its own test standard\u2014known as circular logic\u2014because it cannot reliably reveal bugs. Instead, source test expectations from reliable, external standards or reference calculations to ensure validity and rigor.\\n>\\n> **White Box vs. Black Box Testing Approaches**\\n>\\n> Two approaches define C++ unit testing:\\n>\\n> - **White Box Testing**: Tests directly access private code areas using workarounds like friend classes, allowing tests to examine internal states. However, this method ties tests closely to code structure, making future refactoring more challenging.\\n> - **Black Box Testing**: Tests only interact with public interfaces, testing expected behaviors from an end-user perspective. Black Box Testing is recommended for maintainability, as it allows refactoring without breaking tests by focusing on behavior rather than code internals.\\n>\\n> **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Documentation**\\n>\\n> BDD guides developers to create tests focused on expected behaviors, providing intuitive documentation. Each test names and validates a specific behavior, such as \\"a new cup is empty,\\" which makes understanding the code straightforward for future developers.\\n>\\n> **Designing Readable and Maintainable Tests**\\n>\\n> Readable and maintainable tests are simple and free of unnecessary complexity. Every unit test should focus on a single behavior, making tests easy to interpret and troubleshoot. This clarity is essential for enabling reviewers to understand test intentions without knowing the code intimately.\\n>\\n> **Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Its Role in Design**\\n>\\n> TDD reinforces software design by encouraging developers to write tests before code. Known as the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle, TDD begins with writing a failing test (Red), creating code to make the test pass (Green), and refining the code (Refactor). This practice minimizes bugs from the outset, refines design, and builds a stable foundation of tests to verify code during refactoring."},{"id":"/2024/10/13/links-from-my-inbox","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/13/links-from-my-inbox","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2024-10-13-links-from-my-inbox.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-13-links-from-my-inbox.md","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-10-13","description":"\u231a Nice watch!","date":"2024-10-13T18:32:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 13, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":35.07,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-10-13","date":"2024-10-13T18:32:00.000Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-11-16","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/16/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-09-15","permalink":"/blog/2024/09/15/links-from-my-inbox"}},"content":"## \u231a Nice watch!\\n\\nIn this blog post, I\'ll be sharing a collection of videos with concise content digests.

For example, if a feature has been deprecated but not fully removed, ensure its code is deleted.\\n>    - **Techniques for identifying dead code**: Use tools like static analysis, manual code review, or testing. **Action**: Rename the suspected dead function, rebuild, and let the compiler flag errors where the function is still being used.\\n>    - **Using static analysis and compilers**: These tools help identify unreachable or unused code. **Action**: Regularly run tools like **CPPCheck** or **Clang Analyze** in your CI pipeline to detect dead code.\\n>    - **Renaming functions to detect dead code**: A simple way to identify unused code. **Action**: Rename a function (e.g., `myFunction` to `myFunction_old`), and see if it causes errors during the build process. If not, the function is likely dead and can be safely removed.\\n>    - **Deleting dead features and their subtle dependencies**: Features often have dependencies that may be missed. **Action**: When removing a dead feature, check for subtle references, such as menu items, command-line flags, or other parts of the system that may still rely on it.\\n>\\n> 2. **Caution with Large Codebase Changes**\\n>    - **Taking small, careful steps**: Removing too much at once can lead to major issues. **Action**: Remove a small function or part of the code, test, and repeat. For example, instead of removing an entire module, start with one function.\\n>    - **Avoiding aggressive feature removal**: Over-removal can cause unexpected failures. **Action**: Approach code deletion incrementally. Don\u2019t aim to delete an entire feature at once; instead, tease out its components slowly to avoid breaking dependencies.\\n>    - **Moving code to reduce scope**: If code is not needed at the global scope, move it to a more local context. **Action**: Move public functions from header files to `.cpp` files and see if any errors occur. This can help isolate the function\u2019s scope and make it easier to remove later.\\n>    - **Risk of breaking builds**: Avoid breaking the build with massive deletions. **Action**: Ensure you take incremental steps, test continuously, and use atomic commits to revert small changes if needed.\\n>\\n> 3. **Refactoring Approaches**\\n>    - **Iterative refactoring and deletion**: Refactor code in small steps to ensure stability. **Action**: When removing a dead function, check what other code depends on it. If a function calling it becomes unused, continue refactoring iteratively.\\n>    - **Refactoring legacy code**: Legacy code can often hide dead functions. **Action**: Slowly reduce the scope of legacy functions by moving them to lower levels (like `.cpp` files) to see if their usage drops. If not used anymore, delete them.\\n>    - **Using unit tests for refactoring**: Ensure that code works after refactoring. **Action**: Wrap legacy string classes or custom utility functions in unit tests, then replace the core logic with modern STL alternatives. If the tests pass, the old code can be removed safely.\\n>    - **Replacing custom features with third-party libraries**: Many custom solutions from the past can now be replaced by modern libraries. **Action**: If you have a custom logger class, consider replacing it with a more standardized and robust library like **spdlog**.\\n>\\n> 4. **Working with Tools**\\n>    - **Using plugins or IDEs**: Most modern IDEs can help identify dead code. **Action**: Use Visual Studio or IntelliJ plugins that flag unreachable code or highlight unused functions.\\n>    - **Leveraging Compiler Explorer**: Use online tools to isolate and test specific snippets of code. **Action**: If you can\u2019t refactor in the main codebase, copy the function into **Compiler Explorer** (godbolt.org) and experiment with it there before making changes.\\n>    - **Setting compiler flags**: Enable warnings for unreachable or unused code. **Action**: Use **-Wall** or **-Wextra** in GCC or Clang to flag potentially dead code. For example, set `Wextra` in your build system to catch unused variables and unreachable code.\\n>    - **Running static analysis tools**: Integrate tools like **CPPCheck** into your CI pipeline. **Action**: Add **CPPCheck** to Jenkins and run it with `-j` to detect dead functions across multiple translation units.\\n>\\n> 5. **Source Control Best Practices**\\n>    - **Atomic commits**: Always break down deletions into small, reversible changes. **Action**: Commit changes one at a time and with meaningful messages, such as \\"Deleted unused function `myFunction()`.\\" This allows you to easily revert just one commit if needed.\\n>    - **Small steps and green builds**: Ensure the build passes after each commit. **Action**: Commit your changes, wait for the CI pipeline to return a green build, and only proceed if everything passes.\\n>    - **Keeping history in the main branch**: Deleting code in a branch risks losing history. **Action**: Perform deletions in the main branch with proper commit messages. In Git, avoid squashing commits when merging deletions, as this may obscure your work history.\\n>\\n> 6. **Communication and Collaboration**\\n>    - **Educating teams about dead code**: Not everyone understands the importance of cleaning up dead code. **Action**: When you find dead code, educate the team by documenting what you\u2019ve removed and why.\\n>    - **Communicating when deleting shared code**: Deleting code that others may rely on needs consensus. **Action**: Start a conversation with the team and document the code you intend to delete. Make sure the removal won\u2019t disrupt anyone\u2019s work.\\n>    - **Seasonal refactoring**: Pick quieter periods like holidays for large-scale refactoring. **Action**: Plan code cleanups during slower times (e.g., Christmas or summer) when fewer developers are working. For example, take the three days between Christmas and New Year to remove unused code while avoiding merge conflicts.\\n>\\n> 7. **Handling Legacy Features**\\n>    - **Addressing dead features tied to legacy systems**: These can be tricky to remove without causing issues. **Action**: Mark features as deprecated first, communicate with stakeholders, and plan their removal after a safe period.\\n>    - **Managing end-of-life features carefully**: Inform customers and stakeholders before removing any external-facing features. **Action**: Announce the feature\u2019s end-of-life, allow time for feedback, and only remove the feature after this period (e.g., six months).\\n>\\n> 8. **Miscellaneous Code Cleanup**\\n>    - **Removing unnecessary includes**: Many includes are added but never removed. **Action**: Comment out all include statements at the top of a file, then add them back one by one to see which ones are actually needed.\\n>    - **Deleting repeated or needless code**: Repeated code should be factored into functions or libraries. **Action**: If you find duplicated code, refactor it into a helper function or a shared library to reduce repetition.\\n>\\n> 9. **Comments in Code**\\n>    - **Avoiding inane comments**: Comments that explain obvious code operations are distracting. **Action**: Delete comments like \u201c// increment i by 1\u201d that explain simple logic you can deduce from reading the code.\\n>    - **Recognizing risks in outdated comments**: Old comments can hide the fact that code has changed. **Action**: When refactoring, ensure comments are either updated or removed to avoid misleading information about the code\u2019s purpose.\\n>    - **Focusing on clean code**: Let the code speak for itself. **Action**: Favor well-written, self-explanatory code that requires minimal commenting. For instance, use descriptive function names like `calculateTotal()` instead of adding comments like \u201c// This function calculates the total.\u201d\\n>\\n> 10. **When to Delete Code**\\n>     - **Timing deletions carefully**: Avoid risky deletions right before a release. **Action**: Plan large code cleanups in advance, and avoid removing any code near a major product release when stability is crucial.\\n>     - **Refactoring during quiet periods**: Use downtimes, such as post-release, for cleanup. **Action**: After a major release or during holidays, revisit old tasks marked for deletion.\\n>     - **Tracking deletions in the backlog**: Use a backlog to schedule code deletions that can\u2019t be done immediately. **Action**: Create a \\"technical debt\\" section in your backlog and record all dead code identified for future cleanup.\\n>\\n> 11. **Final Thoughts on Refactoring**\\n>     - **Challenging bad habits**: Sometimes teams resist deleting old code. **Action**: Slowly introduce refactoring practices, starting small to show the benefits.\\n>     - **Measuring and recording progress**: Keep track of all dead code and document changes. **Action**: Use tools like Jira to track deletions and improvements in code health.\\n>     - **Deleting responsibly**: Don\u2019t delete code just for the sake of it. **Action**: Ensure that deleted code is truly unused and won\u2019t cause issues down the line. For example, test thoroughly before removing any core functionality.\\n\\n2024-09-29 [Insights From an L7 Meta Manager: Interviews, Onboarding, and Building Trust - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1XV6Yg4Nm4) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20241013110406428](2024-10-13-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241013110406428.png)\\n>\\n> ### High-Level Categories of Problems and Solutions\\n>\\n> **1.

This technique involves compiling the header files into an intermediate form that can be reused across different compilation units. By doing so, you significantly reduce the need to repeatedly process these files, cutting down the overall compilation time. Tools like **CMake** can automate this by managing dependencies and ensuring headers are correctly precompiled and reused across builds.\\n>\\n> 2. **Parallel Compilation**: Another approach is **parallel compilation**. Tools like **Make**, **Ninja**, and **distcc** allow you to compile multiple files simultaneously, taking advantage of multi-core processors. For instance, using the `-j` flag in `make` or `ninja` enables you to specify the number of jobs (i.e., compilation tasks) to run in parallel, which can dramatically reduce the time it takes to compile large projects.\\n>\\n> 3. **Unity Builds**: **Unity builds** are another technique where multiple source files are compiled together as a single compilation unit. This reduces the overhead caused by multiple compiler invocations and can be particularly useful for large codebases. However, unity builds can introduce some challenges, such as longer error messages and potential name collisions, so they should be used selectively.\\n>\\n> 4. **Code Optimization**: Structuring your code to minimize dependencies can also be highly effective. Techniques include **forward declarations**, splitting projects into smaller modules with fewer interdependencies, and replacing heavyweight standard library headers with lighter alternatives when possible. By reducing the number of dependencies that need to be recompiled when a change is made, you can significantly decrease compile times.\\n>\\n> 5. **Caching Compilation Results**: Tools like **ccache** store previous compilation results, which can be reused if the source files haven\u2019t changed. This approach is particularly useful in development environments where small, incremental changes are frequent.\\n>\\n> Here is the detailed digest from Andrew Pearcy\'s talk on **\\"Reducing Compilation Times Through Good Design\\"**, along with the relevant project homepages and tools referenced throughout the discussion. \\n>\\n> **Video Title:** [Reducing Compilation Times Through Good Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItcGevumW-8)\\n>\\n> Andrew Pearcy, an engineering team lead at Bloomberg, outlines strategies for significantly reducing C++ compilation times. The talk draws from his experience of cutting build times from one hour to just six minutes, emphasizing practical techniques applicable in various C++ projects.\\n>\\n> ### Motivation for Reducing Compilation Times\\n>\\n> **Pearcy** starts by explaining the critical need to reduce **compilation times**. Long build times lead to context switching, reduced productivity, and delays in CI pipelines, affecting both local development experience and time to market. Additionally, longer compilation times make adopting static analysis tools like **Clang-Tidy** impractical due to the additional overhead. Reducing compilation time also optimizes resource utilization, especially in large companies where multiple machines are involved.\\n>\\n> ### Overview of the C++ Compilation Model\\n>\\n> He recaps the **C++ compilation model**, breaking it down into phases: **pre-processing**, **compilation**, and **linking**. The focus is primarily on the first two stages. Pearcy notes that large header files and unnecessary includes can significantly inflate the amount of code the compiler must process, which in turn increases build time.\\n>\\n> ### Quick Wins: Build System, Linkers, and Compiler Caching\\n>\\n> **1. Build System:**\\n>\\n>    - **Ninja:** Pearcy recommends using **Ninja** instead of **Make** for better dependency tracking and faster incremental builds. Ninja was designed for Google\'s Chromium project and can often be an order of magnitude faster than Make. It utilizes all available cores by default, improving build efficiency.\\n>    - **Ninja Documentation:** [Ninja Build System](https://ninja-build.org/)\\n>\\n> **2. Linkers:**\\n>\\n>    - **LLD and Mold:** He suggests switching to **LLD**, a faster alternative to the default linker, LD. Mold, a modern linker written by Rui Ueyama (who also worked on LLD), is even faster but consumes more memory and is available for Unix platforms as open-source while being a paid service for Mac and Windows.\\n>    - **LLD:** [LLVM Project - LLD](https://lld.llvm.org/)\\n>    - **Mold:** [Mold: A Modern Linker](https://github.com/rui314/mold)\\n>\\n> **3. Compiler Caching:**\\n>\\n>    - **Ccache:** Pearcy strongly recommends **Ccache** for caching compilation results to speed up rebuilds by avoiding recompilation of unchanged files. This tool can be integrated into CI pipelines to share cache across users, which can drastically reduce build times.\\n>    - **Ccache:** [Ccache](https://ccache.dev/)\\n>\\n> Detailed Techniques to Reduce Build Times\\n>\\n> **1. Forward Declarations:**\\n>\\n>    - Pearcy emphasizes the use of **forward declarations** in headers to reduce unnecessary includes, which can prevent large headers from being included transitively across multiple translation units. This reduces the amount of code the compiler needs to process.\\n>\\n> **2. Removing Unused Includes:**\\n>\\n>    - He discusses the challenge of identifying and removing unused includes, mentioning tools like **Include What You Use** and **Graphviz** to visualize dependencies and find unnecessary includes.\\n>    - **Include What You Use:** [Include What You Use](https://include-what-you-use.org/)\\n>    - **Graphviz:** [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)\\n>\\n> **3. Splitting Protocol and Implementation:**\\n>\\n>    - To reduce dependency on large headers, he suggests the **Pimpl (Pointer to Implementation) Idiom** or creating interfaces that hide the implementation details. This technique helps in isolating the implementation in a single place, reducing the amount of code the compiler needs to process in other translation units.\\n>\\n> **4. Precompiled Headers (PCH):**\\n>\\n>    - Using **precompiled headers** for frequently included but rarely changed files, such as standard library headers, can significantly reduce build times. However, he warns against overusing PCHs as they can lead to diminishing returns if too many headers are precompiled.\\n>    - CMake added support for PCH in version 3.16, allowing easy integration into the build process.\\n>    - **CMake Precompiled Headers:** [CMake Documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_precompile_headers.html)\\n>\\n> **5. Unity Build:**\\n>\\n>    - Pearcy introduces **Unity builds**, where multiple translation units are combined into a single one, reducing redundant processing of headers and improving build times. This technique is particularly effective in reducing overall build times but can introduce issues like naming collisions in anonymous namespaces.\\n>    - CMake provides built-in support for Unity builds, with options to batch files to balance parallelization and memory usage.\\n>    - **Unity Build Documentation:** [CMake Unity Builds](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/UNITY_BUILD.html)\\n\\n2024-07-26 [Turbocharged: Writing High-Performance C# and .NET Code - Steve Gordon - NDC Oslo 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SXr48OYxbA)\\n\\n> ![image-20241013111239413](2024-10-13-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20241013111239413.png)\\n>\\n> **Turbocharging Your .NET Code with High-Performance APIs**\\n>\\n> Steve, a Microsoft MVP and engineer at Elastic, discusses various high-performance APIs in .NET that can optimize application performance. The session covers measuring and improving performance, focusing on execution time, throughput, and memory allocations.\\n>\\n> **Performance in Application Code** Performance is measured by how quickly code executes, the throughput (how many tasks an application can handle in a given timeframe), and memory allocations. High memory allocations can lead to frequent garbage collections, impacting performance. Steve emphasizes that performance optimization is contextual, meaning not every application requires the same level of optimization.\\n>\\n> **Optimization Cycle** The optimization cycle involves measuring current performance, making small changes, and re-measuring to ensure improvements. Tools like Visual Studio profiling, PerfView, and JetBrains products are useful for profiling and measuring performance. BenchmarkDotNet is highlighted for micro-benchmarking, providing precise measurements by running benchmarks multiple times to get accurate data.\\n>\\n> **High-Performance Code Techniques**\\n>\\n> 1. **`Span<T>`**: A type that provides a read/write view over contiguous memory, allowing for efficient slicing and memory operations. It is highly efficient with constant-time operations for slicing.\\n> 2. **Array Pool**: A pool for reusing arrays to avoid frequent allocations and deallocations. Using the `ArrayPool<T>.Shared` pool allows for efficient memory reuse, reducing short-lived allocations.\\n> 3. **System.IO.Pipelines**: Optimizes reading and writing streams by managing buffers and minimizing overhead. It is particularly useful in scenarios like high-performance web servers.\\n> 4. **System.Text.Json**: A high-performance JSON API introduced in .NET Core 3. It includes low-level `Utf8JsonReader` and `Utf8JsonWriter` for zero-allocation JSON parsing, as well as higher-level APIs for serialization and deserialization.\\n>\\n> **Examples and Benchmarks** Steve presents examples of using these APIs in real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant performance gains. For instance, using `Span<T>` and `ArrayPool` in a method that processes arrays and messages led to reduced execution time and memory allocations. Switching to `System.IO.Pipelines` and `System.Text.Json` resulted in similar improvements.\\n>\\n> > \\"Slicing is really just changing the view over an existing block of memory... it\'s a constant time, constant cost operation.\\"\\n>\\n> > \\"Measure your code, don\u2019t assume, don\u2019t make assumptions with benchmarks, it\u2019s dangerous.\\"\\n>\\n> **Conclusion** Optimizing .NET code with high-performance APIs requires careful measurement and iterative improvements. While not all applications need such optimizations, those that do can benefit from significant performance gains. Steve concludes by recommending the book \\"[Pro .NET Memory Management](https://prodotnetmemory.com/)\\" for a deeper understanding of memory management in .NET.\\n\\n2024-07-07 [[Theo - t3\u2024gg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) My Spiciest Take On Tech Hiring - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLvqAv_u4fs)\\n\\n>  2024-07-07 [Haskell for all: My spiciest take on tech hiring](https://www.haskellforall.com/2024/06/my-spiciest-take-on-tech-hiring.html)\\n\\n> ![image-20240707101322999](2024-10-13-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240707101322999.png)\\n\\n> **High-Level Categories of Problems**\\n>\\n> 1. **Tech Hiring Process Issues**\\n>    - **Too Many Interviews (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Candidates face multiple rounds of interviews (up to seven), causing frustration and inefficiency. Many find it counterproductive to go through so many technical interviews.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Overly complex hiring processes that assume more interviews lead to better candidates.\\n>      *Advice*: Implement a streamlined process with just **one technical interview** and **one non-technical interview**, each lasting no more than one hour. Long interview processes are unnecessary and may filter out good candidates.\\n>\\n>    - **Interview Redundancy (00)**:\\n>      *Problem*: The same type of technical questions are asked repeatedly across different interviews, leading to duplication.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Lack of coordination among interviewers and reliance on similar types of technical questions.\\n>      *Advice*: Ensure **each interviewer asks unique, relevant questions** and does not rely on others to gather the same information. Interviewers should bear **ultimate responsibility** for gathering critical data.\\n>\\n>    - **Bias in Hiring (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Interview processes are biased because hiring managers may already have preferred candidates (referrals, strong portfolios) before the process begins.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Pre-existing relationships with candidates or prior work experience influence decisions.\\n>      *Advice*: Avoid dragging out the process to **mask biases**\u2014shorter, efficient interviews can make the bias more visible but manageable. Long processes don\'t necessarily filter out bias.\\n>\\n>    - **Long Interview Processes Favor Privilege (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Prolonged interview panels select for candidates who can afford to take time off work, favoring those from more privileged backgrounds.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Candidates from less privileged backgrounds cannot afford to engage in drawn-out interviews.\\n>      *Advice*: Shorten the interview length and focus on relevant qualifications. Ensure accessibility for all candidates by keeping the process simple.\\n>\\n> 2. **Interview Process Structure**\\n>    - **Diffusion of Responsibility (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: In group interview settings, responsibility for hiring decisions is diffused, leading to poor or delayed decision-making.\\n>      *Root Cause*: No single person feels accountable for making the final decision.\\n>      *Advice*: **Assign ownership** of decisions by giving specific interviewers responsibility for crucial aspects of the process. This reduces the likelihood of indecision and delayed outcomes.\\n>\\n>    - **Hiring Based on Team Fit vs. Technical Ability (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Emphasis on technical abilities often overshadows the importance of team compatibility.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Focus on technical skills without considering cultural and interpersonal dynamics within the team.\\n>      *Advice*: Ensure that interviews assess not only technical competence but also how well candidates **fit into the team dynamic**. Incorporate **group discussions** or **casual settings** (e.g., lunch meetings) to gauge team vibe.\\n>\\n>    - **Ambiguity in Interviewer Opinions (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Some interviewers avoid committing to clear opinions about candidates, preferring neutral stances.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Lack of confidence or fear of being overruled by the majority.\\n>      *Advice*: Use a **rating system** (e.g., 1\u20134 scale) that forces interviewers to choose a strong opinion, either in favor or against a candidate.\\n>\\n> 3. **Candidate Experience and Behavior**\\n>    - **Negative Behavior in Interviews (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Candidates who perform well technically but exhibit unprofessional behavior (e.g., showing up late or hungover) can still pass through the hiring process.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Strong technical performance may overshadow concerns about professionalism and reliability.\\n>      *Advice*: Balance technical performance with **non-technical evaluations**. Weigh behaviors such as punctuality and professional demeanor just as heavily as coding skills.\\n>\\n>    - **Take-Home Tests and Challenges (00)**:\\n>      *Problem*: Some candidates view take-home challenges as extra, unnecessary work, while others see them as a chance to showcase skills.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Different candidates have different preferences and responses to technical assessments.\\n>      *Advice*: **Offer take-home tests** as an option, but don\'t make them mandatory. Adjust the evaluation method based on candidate preferences to ensure both parties feel comfortable.\\n>\\n> 4. **Systemic Issues in the Hiring Process**\\n>    - **Healthcare Tied to Jobs (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: In the U.S., job-based healthcare forces candidates to accept positions they might not want or complicates transitions between jobs.\\n>      *Root Cause*: The healthcare system is tied to employment, making job transitions risky.\\n>      *Advice*: There\'s no direct solution provided here, but **highlighting the need for systemic changes** in healthcare could make the hiring process more equitable.\\n>\\n>    - **Lack of Feedback to Candidates (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Many companies avoid giving feedback to candidates after interviews, leaving them unsure of their performance.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Fear of legal liability or workload concerns.\\n>      *Advice*: **Provide constructive feedback** to candidates, even if they aren\'t selected. It helps build **long-term relationships** and contributes to positive company reputation. Some of the best connections come from transparent feedback post-interview.\\n>\\n> 5. **Hiring for Senior Positions**\\n>    - **Senior Candidates Have Low Tolerance for Long Processes (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Highly qualified senior candidates are more likely to decline long and drawn-out interview processes.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Senior candidates, due to their experience and expertise, are less willing to tolerate inefficient processes.\\n>      *Advice*: **Streamline the process** for senior roles. Keep interviews short, efficient, and focused on **relevant discussions**. High-level candidates prefer concise assessments over lengthy ones.\\n>\\n> 6. **Hiring on Trust vs. Formal Interviews**\\n>    - **Hiring Based on Relationships (00)**: \\n>      *Problem*: Engineers with pre-existing relationships or referrals are more likely to be hired than those without, bypassing formal interviews.\\n>      *Root Cause*: Prior work relationships build trust, which can overshadow the need for formal vetting.\\n>      *Advice*: **Trust-based hiring** should be encouraged when there is prior working experience with the candidate. However, make efforts to balance trust with fairness by including formal evaluations where necessary.\\n>\\n> **Key Problems Summary**\\n>\\n> - The **length and complexity** of the hiring process discourages many strong candidates, particularly **senior-level** applicants. Simplifying the process to **two interviews** (one technical and one non-technical) is recommended.\\n> - **Bias** in the hiring process, particularly when managers have **pre-existing relationships** with candidates, leads to unfair outcomes.\\n> - Long interview processes **favor privileged candidates** who can afford to take time off, disadvantaging those from less privileged backgrounds.\\n> - Providing **feedback** to candidates is crucial for building long-term relationships and ensuring a positive hiring experience, yet it\'s often avoided due to legal concerns.\\n> - **Team fit** is just as important as technical skills, and companies should incorporate group interactions to assess interpersonal dynamics.\\n>\\n> **Most Critical Issues and Solutions**\\n>\\n> - **Problem**: Too many technical interviews create frustration and inefficiency.\\n>   **Solution**: Use just **one technical and one non-technical** interview, and assign responsibility for gathering all relevant information during these sessions.\\n>\\n> - **Problem**: Bias due to pre-existing relationships.\\n>   **Solution**: Shorten the process to expose bias more clearly and **rely on trust-based hiring** only when balanced with formal interviews.\\n>\\n> - **Problem**: Lack of feedback to candidates.\\n>   **Solution**: **Provide constructive feedback** to help candidates improve and establish long-term professional relationships."},{"id":"/2024/09/15/links-from-my-inbox","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/09/15/links-from-my-inbox","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2024-09-15-links-from-my-inbox.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-15-links-from-my-inbox.md","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-09-15","description":"Good Reads","date":"2024-09-15T21:15:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 15, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":14.265,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-09-15","date":"2024-09-15T21:15:00.000Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-10-13","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/13/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-09-01","permalink":"/blog/2024/09/01/links-from-my-inbox"}},"content":"## Good Reads\\n\\n2024-08-27 [Four Lessons from 2023 That Forever Changes My Software Engineering Career | by Yifeng Liu | Medium | Medium](https://medium.com/@HobokenDays/four-career-lessons-learned-in-2023-that-forever-changed-my-software-engineering-career-52e577b05435) { medium.com }\\n\\n> This past year, four key lessons transformed my approach to software engineering.\\n>\\n> First, I learned that **execution is as important as the idea itself**. Inspired by Steve Jobs, who highlighted the gap between a great idea and a great product, I focused on **rapid prototyping** to test feasibility and **internal presentations** to gather feedback. I kept my manager informed to ensure we were aligned and honest about challenges.\\n>\\n> Second, I realized that **trust and credibility are fragile** but crucial. As a senior engineer, I\'m expected to lead by solving complex issues and guiding projects. I saw firsthand how failing to execute or pushing unrealistic timelines could quickly erode trust within my team.\\n>\\n> The third lesson was about the importance of **visibility**. I understood that hard work could go unnoticed if I didn\u2019t make it visible. I began taking ownership of impactful projects and increased my public presence through presentations and updates. I also honed my **critical thinking** to offer valuable feedback and identify improvement opportunities.\\n>\\n> Finally, I learned to **focus on changing myself rather than others**. I used to try to change my team or company, but now I realize it\u2019s more effective to work on my growth and influence others through my actions. Understanding the company\u2019s culture and my colleagues\' aspirations helped me align my efforts with my career goals.\\n>\\n> These lessons have reshaped my career and how I approach my role as an engineer.\\n\\n2024-08-28 [Just use fucking paper, man - Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/just-fucking-use-paper-man/) { andy-bell.co.uk }\\n\\n> 27th of August 2024\\n>\\n> I\u2019ve tried Notion, Obsidian, Things, Apple Reminders, Apple Notes, [Jotter](https://jotter.space/) and endless other tools to keep me organised and sure, Notion has stuck around the most because we use it for client stuff, but for todo lists, all of the above are *way too complicated.*\\n>\\n> I\u2019ve given up this week and gone back to paper and a pencil and I feel unbelievably organised and flexible, day-to-day.

My concern is that FOSS thrives on surplus\u2014both from the software industry and the labor of developers. This surplus has been fueled by high margins in the tech industry, easy access to investment, and developers who have the time and financial freedom to contribute to FOSS projects. However, I\'m worried that these resources are drying up.\\n>\\n> High interest rates are making investments scarcer, particularly for non-AI software, which doesn\'t really support open-source principles. The post-COVID economic correction is leading to layoffs and higher coder unemployment, which means fewer people have the time or incentive to contribute to FOSS. OSS burnout is another issue, with fewer fresh developers stepping in to replace those who are exhausted by maintaining projects that often lack supportive communities.\\n>\\n> Companies are also cutting costs and questioning the value of FOSS. Why invest in open-source projects when the return on investment is uncertain? The rise of LLM-generated code is further disconnecting potential contributors from FOSS projects, weakening the communities that sustain them.\\n>\\n> My fear is that FOSS is entering a period of decline. As the industry and labor surpluses shrink, FOSS projects might suffer from neglect, security issues, or even collapse. While some of this decline might be a necessary correction, it\'s hard not to worry about the future of the FOSS ecosystem, especially when we don\'t know which parts are sustainable and which are not.\\n\\n2024-08-29 [Why does getting a job in tech suck right now?

The author describes this as the **Hydra Effect**\u2014each task completed leads to new challenges. Unfinished projects feel full of potential, but **fear of imperfection** or even **success** prevents many developers from finishing.\\n>\\n> > \\"An unfinished project is full of intoxicating potential.

Finishing is crucial for growth, both technically and professionally.\\n>\\n> > \\"By not finishing, you miss out on these valuable learning experiences.\\"\\n>\\n> To break this cycle, the author offers strategies: **define \\"done\\" early**, focus on **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product), **time-box** projects, and **separate ideation from implementation**. Practicing small completions and using **accountability** are also recommended to build the habit of finishing.\\n>\\n> The article emphasizes that overcoming the Hydra Effect requires **discipline** but leads to personal and professional growth.\\n\\n2024-09-11 [Improving Application Availability: The Basics | by Mario Bittencourt | SSENSE-TECH | Aug, 2024 | Medium](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/improving-application-availability-the-basics-f6c3365235fc) { medium.com }\\n\\n> In this article, I introduce the essentials of **application availability** and how to approach **high availability**. High availability is measured by **uptime percentage**. Achieving **99.999%** availability (five nines) means accepting no more than **5 minutes of downtime** per year, which requires **automation** to detect and fix issues fast.\\n>\\n> I discuss **redundancy** as a key strategy to improve availability by using backups for **connectivity, compute resources, and persistence**. If one component fails, the system switches to a secondary option. However, redundancy adds both **cost** and **complexity**. More components require advanced tools, like **load balancers**, to manage failures, but these solutions introduce their own reliability concerns.\\n>\\n> Not every part of an application needs the same **availability target**. In an **e-commerce** system, for instance, I categorize components into **tiers**: \\n>\\n> - **T1** (website and payments) must stay available at all times.\\n> - **T2** (order management) allows some downtime.\\n> - **T3** (fulfillment) can tolerate longer outages.\\n> - **T4** (ERP) has the least strict requirements.\\n>\\n> > \\"Your goal is to perform an impact analysis and classify each component in tiers according to its criticality and customer impact.\\"\\n>\\n> By setting different **availability targets** for each tier, you can reduce costs while focusing on the most important parts of your system.\\n>\\n> > \\"All strategies to improve availability come with trade-offs, usually involving higher costs and complexity.\\"\\n>\\n> This sets the stage for future discussions on **graceful degradation**, **asynchronous processing**, and **disaster recovery** strategies.\\n\\n2024-09-12 [A Bunch of Programming Advice I\u2019d Give To Myself 15 Years Ago Marcus\' Blog](https://mbuffett.com/posts/programming-advice-younger-self/) { mbuffett.com }\\n\\n> If the team is constantly tripping over a recurring issue, it\'s crucial to **fix the root cause**, rather than repeatedly patching symptoms. The author mentions, \\"I decided to fix it, and it took ten minutes to update our subscription layer to call subscribers on the main thread instead,\\" thereby removing the cause of crashes, streamlining the codebase, and reducing mental overhead.\\n>\\n> **Pace versus quality** must be balanced based on context. In low-risk environments, it\'s okay to ship faster and rely on guardrails; in high-risk environments (like handling sensitive data), quality takes precedence. \\"You don\u2019t need 100% test coverage or an extensive QA process, which will slow down the pace of development,\\" when bugs can be fixed easily. \\n>\\n> **Sharpening your tools** is always worth it. Being efficient with your IDE, shortcuts, and dev tools will pay off over time. Fast typing, proficiency in the **shell**, and knowing browser tools matter. Although people warn against over-optimizing configurations, \\"I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone actually overdo this.\\"\\n>\\n> When something is hard to explain, it\'s likely **incidental complexity**. Often, complexity isn\'t inherent but arises from the way things are structured. If you can\'t explain why something is difficult, it\u2019s worth simplifying. The author reflects that \\"most of the complexity I was explaining was incidental... I could actually address that first.\\"\\n>\\n> **Solve bugs at a deeper level**, not just by patching the immediate issue. If a React component crashes due to null `user` data, you could add a conditional return, but it\u2019s better to prevent the state from becoming null in the first place. This creates more **robust systems** and a clearer understanding of how things work.\\n>\\n> Investigating bugs should include **reviewing code history**. The author discovered a memory leak after reviewing commits, realizing the issue stemmed from recent code changes. **Git history** can be essential for debugging complex problems that aren\'t obvious through logs alone. \\n>\\n> Write **bad code** when needed to get feedback. Perfect code takes too long and may not be necessary in every context. It\'s better to ship something that works, gather feedback, and refine it. \\"If you err on the side of writing perfect code, you don\u2019t get any feedback.\\"\\n>\\n> **Make debugging easier** by building systems that streamline the process. Small conveniences like logging state diffs after every update or restricting staging environment parallelism to 1 can save huge amounts of time. The author stresses, \\"If it\u2019s over 50%, you should figure out how to make it easier.\\"\\n>\\n> Working on a team means **asking questions** when needed. Especially in the first few months, it\'s faster to ask a coworker for a solution than spending hours figuring it out solo. Asking isn\u2019t seen as a burden, so long as it\u2019s not something trivial that could be self-solved in minutes.\\n>\\n> Maintaining a fast **shipping cadence** is critical in startups and time-sensitive projects. Speed compounds over time, and improving systems, reusable patterns, and processes that support fast shipping is essential. \\"Shipping slowly should merit a post-mortem as much as breaking production does.\\"\\n>\\n>\\n> This article reaction and discussion on youtube: \\n>\\n> 2024-09-12 [ Theo Unexpected Lessons I\'ve Learned After 15 Years Of Coding - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h7Lc85RDLo) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n2024-09-14 [We need to talk about \\"founder mode\\" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDWs3XU3ESo) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> \\"Stop hiring for the things you don\'t want to do. Hire for the things you **love** to do so you\'re forced to deal with the things you don\'t want to do.\\n>\\n> This is some of the best advice I\'ve been giving lately. Early on, I screwed up by hiring an editor because I didn\'t like editing. Since I didn\'t love editing, I couldn\'t be a great workplace for an editor\u2014I couldn\'t relate to them, and they felt alone. My bar for a good edit was low because I just wanted the work off my plate.\\n>\\n> But when I started editing my own stuff, I got pretty good and actually started to like it. Now, I genuinely think I\'ll stop recording videos before I stop editing them. By doing those things myself, I ended up falling in love with them.\\n>\\n> Apply this to startups: If you\'re a founder who loves coding, hire someone to do it so you can\'t focus all your time on it. Focus on the other crucial parts of your business that need your attention.\\n>\\n> Don\'t make the mistake of hiring to avoid work.

Sprints in **Scrum** are constant, unlike the traditional **Waterfall** model where high-pressure periods are followed by low-pressure times. Sprints create ongoing, medium-level **stress**, which is more damaging long-term than short-term, intense stress. Long-term stress harms both **mental** and **physical health**.\\n> **Advice**: Build in deliberate **breaks** between sprints. Allow teams time to recover, reflect, and recalibrate before the next sprint. Introduce **buffer periods** for less intense work or creative activities.\\n>\\n> \ud83d\udd16 Sprints are **involuntary**. Sprints in a Scrum environment are often imposed on developers, leaving them no control over the **process** or duration. Lack of **autonomy** leads to higher stress, similar to studies where forced activity triggers stress responses in animals. Control over work processes can reduce stress and improve **job satisfaction**.\\n> **Advice**: Involve the team in the **sprint planning** process and give them a say in determining task durations, sprint length, and workload. Increase **autonomy** to reduce stress by tailoring the Scrum process to fit the team\u2019s needs rather than rigidly following preset rules.\\n>\\n> \ud83d\ude21 Sprints neglect key supporting activities. Scrum focuses on completing tasks within sprint cycles but doesn\u2019t allocate enough time for essential **preparatory activities** like brainstorming and research. The lack of **preparation time** creates stress and leads to suboptimal work because **thinking** and **doing** cannot be entirely separated.\\n> **Advice**: Allocate time within sprints for essential **preparation**, brainstorming, and research. Set aside dedicated periods for planning, learning, or **technical exploration**, rather than expecting full-time execution during the sprint.\\n>\\n> \ud83c\udf77 Most Scrum implementations devolve into **\u201cScrumfall.\u201d** Scrum is often mixed with **Waterfall-like** big-deadline pressures, which cancel out the benefits of sprints and increase stress. When major **deadlines** approach, Scrum practices are suspended, leading to a high-stress environment combining the worst aspects of both methodologies.\\n> **Advice**: Resist combining Waterfall-style big **deadlines** with Scrum. Manage **stakeholder expectations** upfront and break larger goals into smaller deliverables aligned with sprint cycles.

Below, each point from the talk is identified and described in detail, followed by relevant C++ code examples to illustrate the discussed concepts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. **SFINAE and Overload Resolution**\\n\\nThe talk begins with a discussion on the use of **SFINAE** (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) and its role in **overload resolution**. SFINAE is a powerful C++ feature that allows template functions to be excluded from overload resolution based on specific conditions, enabling more precise control over which function templates should be used.\\n\\n**Key Points**:\\n- **SFINAE** is used to selectively disable template instantiation based on the properties of template arguments.\\n- Overload resolution in C++ allows for multiple functions or operators with the same name to be defined, as long as their parameters differ. The compiler decides which function to call based on the arguments provided.\\n\\n**C++ Example**:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <type_traits>\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\n// Template function enabled only for arithmetic types using SFINAE\\ntemplate <typename T>\\ntypename std::enable_if<std::is_arithmetic<T>::value, T>::type\\nadd(T a, T b) {\\n    return a + b;\\n}\\n\\n// Overload for non-arithmetic types is not instantiated\\ntemplate <typename T>\\ntypename std::enable_if<!std::is_arithmetic<T>::value, T>::type\\nadd(T a, T b) = delete;\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::cout << add(5, 3) << std::endl;     // OK: int is arithmetic\\n    // std::cout << add(\\"Hello\\", \\"World\\");   // Error: string is not arithmetic\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Compile-Time Error Messages**\\n\\nThe talk transitions into how to improve **compile-time error messages** using `static_assert` and custom error handling in templates. By using these techniques, developers can provide clearer error messages when certain conditions are not met during template instantiation.\\n\\n**Key Points**:\\n- Use `static_assert` to enforce conditions at compile time, ensuring that the program fails to compile if certain criteria are not met.\\n- Improve the readability of error messages by providing meaningful feedback directly in the code.\\n\\n**C++ Example**:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <type_traits>\\n\\ntemplate<typename T>\\nvoid check_type() {\\n    static_assert(std::is_integral<T>::value, \\"T must be an integral type\\");\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    check_type<int>();   // OK\\n    // check_type<double>(); // Compile-time error: T must be an integral type\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Concepts in C++20**\\n\\nThe talk explores **Concepts**, a feature introduced in C++20, which allows developers to specify constraints on template arguments more succinctly and expressively compared to SFINAE. Concepts help in making templates more readable and the error messages more comprehensible.\\n\\n**Key Points**:\\n- **Concepts** define requirements for template parameters, making templates easier to understand and use.\\n- Concepts improve the clarity of both template definitions and error messages.\\n\\n**C++ Example**:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <concepts>\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\ntemplate<typename T>\\nconcept Arithmetic = std::is_arithmetic_v<T>;\\n\\ntemplate<Arithmetic T>\\nT add(T a, T b) {\\n    return a + b;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::cout << add(5, 3) << std::endl;     // OK: int is arithmetic\\n    // std::cout << add(\\"Hello\\", \\"World\\");   // Error: concept \'Arithmetic\' not satisfied\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **Polymorphism and CRTP**\\n\\nThe talk covers **polymorphism** and the **Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)**, a technique where a class template is derived from itself. CRTP allows for static polymorphism at compile time, which can offer performance benefits over dynamic polymorphism.\\n\\n**Key Points**:\\n- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Achieved using inheritance and virtual functions, but comes with runtime overhead due to the use of vtables.\\n- **CRTP**: A pattern that enables polymorphism at compile-time, avoiding the overhead of vtables.\\n\\n**C++ Example**:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\n// CRTP Base class\\ntemplate<typename Derived>\\nclass Base {\\npublic:\\n    void interface() {\\n        static_cast<Derived*>(this)->implementation();\\n    }\\n    \\n    static void staticInterface() {\\n        Derived::staticImplementation();\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nclass Derived1 : public Base<Derived1> {\\npublic:\\n    void implementation() {\\n        std::cout << \\"Derived1 implementation\\" << std::endl;\\n    }\\n    \\n    static void staticImplementation() {\\n        std::cout << \\"Derived1 static implementation\\" << std::endl;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nclass Derived2 : public Base<Derived2> {\\npublic:\\n    void implementation() {\\n        std::cout << \\"Derived2 implementation\\" << std::endl;\\n    }\\n    \\n    static void staticImplementation() {\\n        std::cout << \\"Derived2 static implementation\\" << std::endl;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nint main() {\\n    Derived1 d1;\\n    d1.interface();\\n    Derived1::staticInterface();\\n\\n    Derived2 d2;\\n    d2.interface();\\n    Derived2::staticInterface();\\n\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. **Deducing `this` in C++23**\\n\\nThe discussion moves to **deducing `this`**, a feature introduced in C++23 that allows for more expressive syntax when working with member functions, particularly in the context of templates.\\n\\n**Key Points**:\\n- **Deducing `this`** enables more flexible and readable template code involving member functions.\\n- This feature simplifies the syntax when `this` needs to be deduced as part of template metaprogramming.\\n\\n**C++ Example**:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\nclass MyClass {\\npublic:\\n    auto myMethod() const -> decltype(auto) {\\n        return [this] { return *this; };\\n    }\\n    \\n    void print() const {\\n        std::cout << \\"MyClass instance\\" << std::endl;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nint main() {\\n    MyClass obj;\\n    auto f = obj.myMethod();\\n    f().print();  // Outputs: MyClass instance\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. **Design Methodologies: Procedural, OOP, Functional, and Data-Oriented Design**\\n\\nThe final section of the talk compares various **design methodologies** including **Procedural**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Functional Programming (FP)**, and **Data-Oriented Design (DOD)**. Each paradigm has its strengths and use cases, and modern C++ often blends these methodologies to achieve optimal results.\\n\\n**Key Points**:\\n- **Procedural Programming**: Focuses on a sequence of steps or procedures to accomplish tasks.\\n- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Organizes code around objects and data encapsulation.\\n- **Functional Programming (FP)**: Emphasizes immutability and function composition.\\n- **Data-Oriented Design (DOD)**: Focuses on data layout in memory for performance, often used in game development.\\n\\n**C++ Example** (Object-Oriented):\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nclass Telemetry {\\npublic:\\n    virtual void process() const = 0;\\n};\\n\\nclass InstantaneousEvent : public Telemetry {\\npublic:\\n    void process() const override {\\n        std::cout << \\"Processing instantaneous event\\" << std::endl;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nclass LongTermEvent : public Telemetry {\\npublic:\\n    void process() const override {\\n        std::cout << \\"Processing long-term event\\" << std::endl;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nvoid processEvents(const std::vector<Telemetry*>& events) {\\n    for (const auto& event : events) {\\n        event->process();\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::vector<Telemetry*> events = { new InstantaneousEvent(), new LongTermEvent() };\\n    processEvents(events);\\n    \\n    for (auto event : events) {\\n        delete event;\\n    }\\n    \\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**C++ Example** (Functional Programming):\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n#include <algorithm>\\n\\nstruct Event {\\n    int time;\\n    bool isLongTerm;\\n};\\n\\nvoid processEvents(const std::vector<Event>& events) {\\n    std::for_each(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const Event& event) {\\n        if (event.isLongTerm) {\\n            std::cout << \\"Processing long-term event at time \\" << event.time << std::endl;\\n        } else {\\n            std::cout << \\"Processing instantaneous event at time \\" << event.time << std::endl;\\n        }\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::vector<Event> events = { {1, false}, {2, true}, {3, false} };\\n    processEvents(events);\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**C++ Example** (Data-Oriented Design):\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nstruct TelemetryData {\\n    std::vector<int> instantaneousTimes;\\n    std::vector<int> longTermTimes;\\n};\\n\\nvoid processInstantaneous(const std::vector<int>& times) {\\n    for (int time : times) {\\n        std::cout << \\"Processing instantaneous event at time \\" << time << std::endl;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nvoid processLongTerm(const std::vector<int>& times) {\\n    for (int time : times) {\\n        std::cout << \\"Processing long-term event at time \\" << time << std::endl;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    TelemetryData data = {\\n\\n\\n        { 1, 3, 5 },\\n        { 2, 4, 6 }\\n    };\\n    \\n    processInstantaneous(data.instantaneousTimes);\\n    processLongTerm(data.longTermTimes);\\n    \\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n## GPT generated content (with a bit of \\"hallucinations\\")\\n\\nHere\'s the expanded digest with essential text and detailed code examples for each point, focusing on modern replacements for legacy C++ practices.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Legacy Pointers vs. Smart Pointers**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Use of raw pointers, manual memory management, and explicit `new` and `delete`. This can lead to memory leaks, dangling pointers, and undefined behavior.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr` to manage dynamic memory automatically.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nclass LegacyClass {\\n    int* data;\\npublic:\\n    LegacyClass() { data = new int[10]; }\\n    ~LegacyClass() { delete[] data; }\\n};\\n\\n// Modern code\\n#include <memory>\\n\\nclass ModernClass {\\n    std::unique_ptr<int[]> data;\\npublic:\\n    ModernClass() : data(std::make_unique<int[]>(10)) {}\\n    // Destructor not needed, as std::unique_ptr handles memory automatically\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** Using smart pointers reduces the need for manual memory management, preventing common errors like memory leaks and dangling pointers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**C-Style Arrays vs. STL Containers**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Use of C-style arrays, which require manual memory management and do not provide bounds checking.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use `std::vector` for dynamic arrays or `std::array` for fixed-size arrays. These containers handle memory management internally and offer bounds checking.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nint arr[10];\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\\n    arr[i] = i * 2;\\n}\\n\\n// Modern code\\n#include <vector>\\n#include <array>\\n\\nstd::vector<int> vec(10);\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\\n    vec[i] = i * 2;\\n}\\n\\nstd::array<int, 10> arr2;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\\n    arr2[i] = i * 2;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** STL containers provide better safety and ease of use compared to traditional arrays, and should be the default choice in modern C++.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Manual Error Handling vs. Exceptions and `std::expected`**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Return codes or error flags to indicate failures, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use exceptions for error handling, which separate normal flow from error-handling code. Use `std::expected` (from C++23) for functions that can either return a value or an error.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nint divide(int a, int b, bool& success) {\\n    if (b == 0) {\\n        success = false;\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n    success = true;\\n    return a / b;\\n}\\n\\n// Modern code with exceptions\\nint divide(int a, int b) {\\n    if (b == 0) throw std::runtime_error(\\"Division by zero\\");\\n    return a / b;\\n}\\n\\n// Modern code with std::expected (C++23)\\n#include <expected>\\n\\nstd::expected<int, std::string> divide(int a, int b) {\\n    if (b == 0) return std::unexpected(\\"Division by zero\\");\\n    return a / b;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** Exceptions and `std::expected` offer more explicit and manageable error handling, improving code clarity and robustness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Void Pointers vs. Type-Safe Programming**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Use of `void*` for generic programming, leading to unsafe code and difficult debugging.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use templates for type-safe generic programming, ensuring that code is checked at compile time.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nvoid process(void* data, int type) {\\n    if (type == 1) {\\n        int* intPtr = static_cast<int*>(data);\\n        // Process int\\n    } else if (type == 2) {\\n        double* dblPtr = static_cast<double*>(data);\\n        // Process double\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// Modern code\\ntemplate <typename T>\\nvoid process(T data) {\\n    // Process data safely with type known at compile time\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    process(10);      // Automatically deduces int\\n    process(5.5);     // Automatically deduces double\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** Templates provide type safety, ensuring errors are caught at compile time and making code easier to maintain.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Inheritance vs. Composition and Type Erasure**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Deep inheritance hierarchies, which can lead to rigid designs and hard-to-maintain code.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Favor composition over inheritance. Use type erasure (e.g., `std::function`, `std::any`) or `std::variant` to achieve polymorphism without inheritance.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nclass Base {\\npublic:\\n    virtual void doSomething() = 0;\\n};\\n\\nclass Derived : public Base {\\npublic:\\n    void doSomething() override {\\n        // Implementation\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n// Modern code using composition\\nclass Action {\\n    std::function<void()> func;\\npublic:\\n    Action(std::function<void()> f) : func(f) {}\\n    void execute() { func(); }\\n};\\n\\nAction a([]() { /* Implementation */ });\\na.execute();\\n\\n// Modern code using std::variant\\n#include <variant>\\n\\nusing MyVariant = std::variant<int, double, std::string>;\\n\\nvoid process(const MyVariant& v) {\\n    std::visit([](auto&& arg) {\\n        // Implementation for each type\\n    }, v);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** Composition and type erasure lead to more flexible and maintainable designs than traditional deep inheritance hierarchies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Global Variables vs. Dependency Injection**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Use of global variables for shared state, which can lead to hard-to-track bugs and dependencies.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use dependency injection to provide dependencies explicitly, improving testability and modularity.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nint globalCounter = 0;\\n\\nvoid increment() {\\n    globalCounter++;\\n}\\n\\n// Modern code using dependency injection\\nclass Counter {\\n    int count;\\npublic:\\n    Counter() : count(0) {}\\n    void increment() { ++count; }\\n    int getCount() const { return count; }\\n};\\n\\nvoid useCounter(Counter& counter) {\\n    counter.increment();\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    Counter c;\\n    useCounter(c);\\n    std::cout << c.getCount();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** Dependency injection enhances modularity and testability by explicitly providing dependencies rather than relying on global state.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Macros vs. `constexpr` and Inline Functions**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Extensive use of macros for constants and inline code, which can lead to debugging challenges and obscure code.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use `constexpr` for compile-time constants and inline functions for inline code, which are type-safe and easier to debug.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\n#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))\\n\\n// Modern code using constexpr\\nconstexpr int square(int x) {\\n    return x * x;\\n}\\n\\n// Legacy code using macro for constant\\n#define MAX_SIZE 100\\n\\n// Modern code using constexpr\\nconstexpr int maxSize = 100;\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** `constexpr` and inline functions offer better type safety and are easier to debug compared to macros, making the code more maintainable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Manual Resource Management vs. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Manual resource management, requiring explicit release of resources like files, sockets, and memory.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use RAII, where resources are tied to object lifetime and automatically released when the object goes out of scope.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nFILE* file = fopen(\\"data.txt\\", \\"r\\");\\nif (file) {\\n    // Use file\\n    fclose(file);\\n}\\n\\n// Modern code using RAII with std::fstream\\n#include <fstream>\\n\\n{\\n    std::ifstream file(\\"data.txt\\");\\n    if (file.is_open()) {\\n        // Use file\\n    } // File is automatically closed when going out of scope\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Key Insight:** RAII automates resource management, reducing the risk of resource leaks and making code more reliable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Explicit Loops vs. Algorithms and Ranges**\\n\\n**Legacy Practice:** Manual loops for operations like filtering, transforming, or accumulating data.\\n\\n**Modern Replacement:** Use STL algorithms (`std::transform`, `std::accumulate`, `std::copy_if`) and ranges (C++20) to express intent more clearly and concisely.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Legacy code\\nstd::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\\nstd::vector<int> result;\\n\\nfor (auto i : vec) {\\n    if (i % 2 == 0) result.push_back(i * 2);\\n}\\n\\n// Modern code using algorithms\\n#include <algorithm>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nstd::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\\nstd::vector<int> result;\\n\\nstd::transform(vec.begin(), vec.end(), std::back_inserter(result),\\n               [](int x) { return x % 2 == 0 ? x * 2 : 0; });\\nresult.erase(std::remove(result.begin(), result.end(), 0), result.end());\\n\\n// Modern code using ranges (C++20)\\n#include <ranges>\\n\\nauto result = vec | std::views::filter([](int x) { return x % 2 == 0;

While we dominated personal computing, our tools weren\u2019t suitable for managing large data centers. I knew we needed a **command-line interface (CLI)** to compete with Unix, but Microsoft\u2019s culture was deeply rooted in **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)**. Despite widespread skepticism, I was determined to create a tool that could empower administrators to script and automate complex tasks.\\n>\\n> My first major realization was that traditional Unix tools wouldn\u2019t work on Windows because Unix is file-oriented, while Windows is API-oriented. This led me to focus on **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)** as the backbone for our CLI. Despite this, I faced resistance from within. The company only approved a handful of commands when we needed thousands. To solve this, I developed a **metadata-driven architecture** that allowed us to efficiently create and scale commands, laying the foundation for PowerShell.\\n>\\n> However, getting others on board was a challenge. When I encountered a team planning to port a Unix shell to Windows, I knew they were missing the bigger picture. To demonstrate my vision, I locked myself away and wrote a **10,000-line prototype** of what would become PowerShell. This convinced the team to embrace my approach.\\n>\\n> > \u201c**I was able to show them and they said, \u2018Well, what about this?\u2019 And I showed them. And they said, \u2018What about that?\u2019 And I showed them. Their eyes just got big and they\u2019re like, \u2018This, this, this.\u2019**\u201d\\n>\\n> Pursuing this project meant taking a **demotion**, a decision that was financially and personally difficult. But I was convinced that PowerShell could change the world, and that belief kept me going. To align the team, I wrote the **Monad Manifesto**, which became the guiding document for the project. Slowly, I convinced product teams like **Active Directory** to support us, which helped build momentum.\\n>\\n> The project faced another major challenge during Microsoft\u2019s push to integrate everything with **.NET**. PowerShell, built on .NET, was temporarily removed from Windows due to broader integration issues. It took years of persistence to get it back in, but I eventually succeeded.\\n>\\n> PowerShell shipped with **Windows Vista**, but I continued refining it through multiple versions, despite warnings that focusing on this project could harm my career. Over time, PowerShell became a critical tool for managing data centers and was instrumental in enabling Microsoft\u2019s move to the cloud. \\n>\\n> In the end, the key decisions\u2014pushing for a CLI, accepting a demotion, and persisting through internal resistance\u2014led to PowerShell\'s success and allowed me to make a lasting impact on how Windows is managed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2024-09-02 [Netflix/maestro: Maestro: Netflix\u2019s Workflow Orchestrator](https://github.com/Netflix/maestro) { github.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20240901234630103](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240901234630103.png)\\n\\n2024-09-01 [The Scale of Life](https://www.thescaleoflife.com/) { www.thescaleoflife.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20240901153703324](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240901153703324.png)\\n\\n2024-09-01 [opslane/opslane: Making on-call suck less for engineers](https://github.com/opslane/opslane) { github.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20240901152737861](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240901152737861.png)\\n\\n2024-09-01 [Azure Quantum | Learn with quantum katas](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/experience/quantum-katas) { quantum.microsoft.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20240901152236367](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240901152236367.png)\\n\\n>  2024-09-01 [microsoft/QuantumKatas: Tutorials and programming exercises for learning Q# and quantum computing](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas?tab=readme-ov-file) { github.com }\\n\\n\\n\\n2024-09-01 [EP122: API Gateway 101 - ByteByteGo Newsletter](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep122-api-gateway-101) { blog.bytebytego.com }\\n\\n![](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/8725cbb8-4c30-413c-b623-4ca9e235f6d0_1280x1664.webp)\\n\\n\\n\\n2024-09-01 [pladams9/hexsheets: A basic spreadsheet application with hexagonal cells inspired by: http://www.secretgeek.net/hexcel.](https://github.com/pladams9/hexsheets) { github.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20240901010426062](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240901010426062.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n2024-09-01 [Do Quests, Not Goals](https://www.raptitude.com/2024/08/do-quests-not-goals/) { www.raptitude.com }\\n\\n> The other problem with goals is that, outside of sports, \u201cgoal\u201d has become an uninspiring, institutional word.

Here are the key takeaways and approaches from the session:\\n>\\n> **Making Applications Intelligent**: The speaker discusses various interpretations of making an app \\"intelligent.\\" It\u2019s not just about adding a chatbot. While chatbots can create impressive demos quickly, they may not necessarily be useful in production. For AI to be genuinely beneficial, it must save time, improve job performance, and be accurate. The speaker challenges developers to quantify these benefits rather than rely on assumptions.\\n>\\n> > \\"If you try to put it into production, are people going to actually use it? Well, maybe it depends... does this thing actually save people time and enable them to do their job better than they would have otherwise?\\"\\n>\\n> **Patterns of AI Integration**: The speaker introduces several **UI-level AI enhancements** such as **Smart Components**. These are experiments allowing developers to add AI to the UI layer without needing to rebuild the entire app. An example given is a **Smart Paste** feature that allows users to paste large chunks of text, which AI then parses and fills out the corresponding fields in a form. This feature improves user efficiency by reducing the need for repetitive and mundane tasks.\\n>\\n> Another example is the **Smart ComboBox**, which uses **semantic search** to match user input with relevant categories, even when the exact terms do not appear in the list. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where users may not know the exact terminology.\\n>\\n> **Deeper AI Integration**: Moving beyond UI enhancements, the speaker explores deeper layers of AI integration within traditional web applications like e-commerce platforms. For instance, AI can be used to:\\n>\\n> - **Semantic Search**: Improve search functionality so that users don\'t need to know the exact phrasing.\\n> - **Summarization**: Automatically generate descriptive titles for support tickets to help staff quickly identify issues.\\n> - **Classification**: Automatically categorize support tickets to streamline workflows and save staff time.\\n> - **Sentiment Analysis**: Provide sentiment scores to help staff prioritize urgent issues.\\n>\\n> > \\"I think even in this very traditional web application, there\'s clearly lots of opportunity for AI to add a lot of genuine value that will help your staff actually be more productive.\\"\\n>\\n> **Data and AI Integration**: The talk also delves into the importance of data in AI applications. The speaker introduces the **Semantic Kernel**, a .NET library for working with AI, and demonstrates how to generate data using **LLMs (Large Language Models)** locally on the development machine using **Ollama**. The process involves creating categories, products, and related data (like product manuals) in a structured manner.\\n>\\n> **Data Ingestion and Semantic Search**: The speaker showcases how to ingest unstructured data, such as PDFs, and convert them into a format that AI can use for semantic search. Using the **PDFPig** library, the speaker demonstrates extracting text from PDFs, chunking it into smaller, meaningful fragments, and then embedding these chunks into a **semantic space**. This allows for efficient, relevant searches within the data, enhancing the AI\u2019s ability to provide accurate information quickly.\\n>\\n> **Implementing Inference with AI**: As the talk progresses, the speaker moves on to implementing AI-based inference within a **Blazor** application. By integrating **summarization** directly into the workflow, the application can automatically generate summaries of customer interactions, helping support staff to quickly understand the context of a ticket without reading through the entire conversation history.\\n>\\n> > \\"I want to generate an updated summary for it... Generate a summary of the entire conversation log at that point.\\"\\n>\\n> **Function Calling and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: The speaker discusses a more complex AI pattern\u2014**RAG**\u2014which involves the AI model retrieving specific data to answer queries. While standard RAG implementations rely on specific AI platforms, the speaker demonstrates a custom approach that works across various models, including locally run models like **Ollama**. This approach involves checking if the AI has enough context to answer a question and then retrieving relevant information if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Job interview / Algorithms\\n\\n2024-09-01 [Understanding B-Trees: The Data Structure Behind Modern Databases - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1a2Bk8NrYQ) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20240901011314149](./2024-08-30-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240901011314149.png)\\n\\n### Editing Distance\\n\\n2024-09-02 [Needleman\u2013Wunsch algorithm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) { en.wikipedia.org }\\n\\n2024-09-02 [Levenshtein distance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) { en.wikipedia.org }\\n\\n```js\\nfunction LevenshteinDistance(char s[1..m], char t[1..n]):\\n  // for all i and j, d[i,j] will hold the Levenshtein distance between\\n  // the first i characters of s and the first j characters of t\\n  declare int d[0..m, 0..n]\\n \\n  set each element in d to zero\\n \\n  // source prefixes can be transformed into empty string by\\n  // dropping all characters\\n  for i from 1 to m:\\n    d[i, 0] := i\\n \\n  // target prefixes can be reached from empty source prefix\\n  // by inserting every character\\n  for j from 1 to n:\\n    d[0, j] := j\\n \\n  for j from 1 to n:\\n    for i from 1 to m:\\n      if s[i] = t[j]:\\n        substitutionCost := 0\\n      else:\\n        substitutionCost := 1\\n\\n      d[i, j] := minimum(d[i-1, j] + 1,                   // deletion\\n                         d[i, j-1] + 1,                   // insertion\\n                         d[i-1, j-1] + substitutionCost)  // substitution\\n \\n  return d[m, n]\\n```"},{"id":"/2024/08/25/links-from-my-inbox","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/08/25/links-from-my-inbox","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.md","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-08-25","description":"Newsletters","date":"2024-08-26T00:38:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 26, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":12.155,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox 2024-08-25","date":"2024-08-26T00:38:00.000Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-08-30","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/30/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2024-08-06","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/06/links-from-my-inbox"}},"content":"## Newsletters\\n\\n2024-08-26 [JavaScript Weekly Issue 701: August 22, 2024](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/701) { javascriptweekly.com }\\n\\n\\n\\n## Good Reads \\n\\n2024-08-26 \u2b50\ufe0f [On Writing Well | nikhil.bafna](https://zodvik.com/posts/on-writing-well/) { zodvik.com }\\n\\n![image-20240825174540032](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240825174540032.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Tech Talks\\n\\n2024-08-30 [Messaging: The fine line between awesome and awful - Laila Bougria - NDC Oslo 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phAaF6OGjKY) { www.youtube.com }\\n\\n![image-20240829180120559](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240829180120559.png)\\n\\n> Here\'s a digest of the talk:\\n>\\n> I started with a light-hearted introduction about my cultural background and how it relates to having a siesta after lunch, which isn\u2019t an option today since I\'m giving this talk. About a decade ago, I was working on a project where we were building a retail system from scratch for a client. Initially, we created a **monolithic architecture**, which worked well for a while. However, as the business grew, we faced challenges. We saw increased demand and the architecture started showing its limitations. We experienced issues like **failed requests, high strain on the database**, and even system crashes.\\n>\\n> Given the new demands, we decided to evolve our architecture by moving to a **message-based system**. We hoped this would solve our problems by improving performance, increasing resilience, and allowing easier scaling. However, we quickly realized that the transition wasn\u2019t as smooth as expected. Instead of getting faster, the system became slower, and we started experiencing issues with **UI inconsistency**. Customers reported cases where the system didn\'t reflect their actions, leading to confusion and a poor user experience. We also encountered **duplicate messages and messages arriving out of order**, which led to significant failures and side effects in the system.\\n>\\n> One critical lesson we learned was the importance of understanding the **shift from synchronous to asynchronous communication**. In a synchronous system, there\'s a direct, immediate response. But in an asynchronous system, messages might take a while to process, leading to delays and out-of-order execution. This can cause unexpected behaviors in the system, making troubleshooting a lot more challenging.\\n>\\n> To address the issues with **communication patterns**, we explored different messaging patterns like **one-way communication, request-response, and publish-subscribe**. Each has its use case, but we learned that choosing the right pattern is crucial for system stability. For instance, publish-subscribe can be overused, leading to what I call the \\"passive-aggressive publisher\\" problem, where a service publishes an event expecting others to act on it, but without direct control, this can cause problems.\\n>\\n> A key takeaway is that **decoupling** doesn\u2019t happen automatically in a message-based system. It requires deliberate effort to identify service boundaries and manage coupling properly. When splitting a monolith, it\u2019s crucial to ask the right questions about the domain and not just accept the default ordering of processes. For example, questioning whether the order in which tasks are executed is necessary can help in finding opportunities for parallel execution, thereby improving efficiency.\\n>\\n> We also found that managing **SLA (Service Level Agreements)** became essential in an asynchronous environment. We started using **delayed messages** to ensure that tasks were completed within an acceptable time frame. This helped us recover gracefully from both technical and business failures, like handling payment processing delays or credit card issues.\\n>\\n> In the end, it\u2019s not just about transitioning to a new architecture but about understanding the trade-offs and challenges that come with it. The key is to balance the benefits of decoupling with the need to maintain order and consistency in the system. By carefully choosing the right communication patterns and managing the inevitable coupling, we can build systems that are both scalable and resilient, even in the face of growing demand.\\n>\\n> This journey taught us that evolving a system architecture isn\u2019t just about adopting new technologies but also about adapting our approach to fit the new reality. And sometimes, the lessons learned the hard way are the most valuable ones.\\n>\\n> > \u201cOne of the things we also observed is that sometimes we would receive duplicate messages, and the thing is, we didn\u2019t really account for that. So that\u2019s when we started to see failures and even side effects sometimes.\u201d\\n>\\n> > \u201cIf you need a response with any data to continue when you publish an event\u2014no. Then again, passive-aggressive communication and finally if you need any control over who receives or subscribes to that event\u2014also not a good fit.\u201d\\n>\\n> The talk emphasizes the importance of thoughtful architecture decisions, especially when transitioning to a message-based system, and the need for continuous collaboration with business stakeholders to align the system\u2019s behavior with business requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Not a financial advise \\n\\n2024-08-30 [Ditch Banks \u2014 Go With Money Market Funds and Treasuries](https://thefinancebuff.com/goodbye-banks-credit-unions.html) { thefinancebuff.com }\\n\\n> 2024-08-30 [Ditch banks \u2013 Go with money market funds and treasuries | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41262439) { news.ycombinator.com }\\n\\n![image-20240829181735734](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240829181735734.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\n2024-08-30 [YTCH](https://ytch.xyz/) { ytch.xyz }\\n\\n>  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41247023\\n> If YouTube had actual channels\\n\\n![image-20240829190610309](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240829190610309.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n2024-08-30 [GlyphDrawing.Club -blog](https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/font-with-built-in-syntax-highlighting/) { blog.glyphdrawing.club }\\n\\n![image-20240829185659044](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240829185659044.png)\\n\\n2024-08-30 [Vanilla JSX](https://vanillajsx.com/) { vanillajsx.com }\\n\\n> 2024-08-30 [VanillaJSX.com | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41269321) { news.ycombinator.com }\\n\\n![image-20240829181223208](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240829181223208.png)\\n\\n2024-08-30 [Blender Shortcuts](https://hollisbrown.github.io/blendershortcuts/) { hollisbrown.github.io }\\n\\n![image-20240829181030345](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240829181030345.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f Borrow it!\\n\\n2024-08-30 [clemlesne/scrape-it-now: A website to scrape?

Understanding and applying these low-level techniques can be crucial in scenarios where performance is a priority, such as in large projects like **Visual Studio Code**, which relies heavily on manual DOM manipulation for efficiency.\\n>\\n> The article begins with an overview of the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, explaining that it is a tree-like structure where each HTML element represents a node. The common DOM APIs like `querySelector()`, `createElement()`, and `appendChild()` are introduced, emphasizing that while frameworks like React or Angular abstract these details, knowing how to manipulate the DOM directly can lead to performance gains.\\n>\\n> A significant point is the **trade-off between using frameworks and manual DOM manipulation**. While frameworks simplify development, they can also introduce performance overhead through unnecessary re-renders and excessive memory usage. The article argues that in performance-critical applications, direct DOM manipulation can prevent these issues by reducing the garbage collector\'s workload.\\n>\\n> To optimize DOM manipulation, several tips are provided:\\n>\\n> - **Hiding or showing elements** is preferred over creating and destroying them dynamically. This approach keeps the DOM more static, leading to fewer garbage collection calls and reduced client-side logic complexity.\\n> - For example, instead of dynamically creating an element with JavaScript, it\u2019s more efficient to **toggle its visibility** with classes (`el.classList.add(\'show\')` or `el.style.display = \'block\'`).\\n>\\n> Other techniques discussed include:\\n>\\n> - Using **`textContent` instead of `innerText`** for reading content from elements, as it is faster and avoids forcing a reflow.\\n> - **`insertAdjacentHTML`** is preferred over `innerHTML` because it inserts content without destroying existing DOM elements first.\\n> - For the fastest performance, the **`<template>` tag** combined with **`appendChild`** or **`insertAdjacentElement`** is recommended for creating and inserting new DOM elements efficiently.\\n>\\n> The article also covers advanced techniques for managing memory:\\n>\\n> - **`WeakMap` and `WeakRef`** are used to avoid memory leaks by ensuring that references to DOM nodes are properly garbage collected when the nodes are removed from the DOM.\\n> - Proper cleanup of event listeners is emphasized, including methods like **`removeEventListener`**, using the **`once`** parameter, and employing **event delegation** to minimize the number of event listeners in dynamic components.\\n>\\n> For handling multiple event listeners, the **`AbortController`** is introduced as a method to unbind groups of events easily. This can be particularly useful when needing to clean up or cancel multiple event listeners at once.\\n>\\n> The article wraps up with **profiling and debugging** advice. It recommends using Chrome DevTools for memory profiling and JavaScript execution time analysis to ensure that DOM operations do not lead to performance bottlenecks or memory leaks.\\n>\\n> > \\"Efficient DOM manipulation isn\u2019t just about using the right methods\u2014it\u2019s also about understanding when and how often you\u2019re interacting with the DOM.\\"\\n>\\n> The key takeaway is that while frameworks provide convenience, understanding and utilizing these low-level DOM manipulation techniques can significantly enhance the performance of web applications, particularly in performance-sensitive scenarios.\\n\\n\\n\\n### TypeScript\\n\\n2024-08-26 [gruhn/typescript-sudoku: Playing Sudoku in TypeScript while the type checker highlights mistakes.](https://github.com/gruhn/typescript-sudoku) { github.com }\\n\\n![image-20240825175100097](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240825175100097.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Markdown\\n\\n2024-08-26 [Getting Started | Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/docs/guide/getting-started) { milkdown.dev }\\n\\n![image-20240825180829277](./2024-08-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240825180829277.png)\\n\\n> - \ud83d\udcdd **WYSIWYG Markdown** - Write markdown in an elegant way\\n> - \ud83c\udfa8 **Themable** - Create your own theme and publish it as an npm package\\n> - \ud83c\udfae **Hackable** - Create your own plugin to support your awesome idea\\n> - \ud83e\uddbe **Reliable** - Built on top of [prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) and [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)\\n> - \u26a1 **Slash & Tooltip** - Write faster than ever, enabled by a plugin.\\n> - \ud83e\uddee **Math** - LaTeX math equations support via math plugin\\n> - \ud83d\udcca **Table** - Table support with fluent ui, via table plugin\\n> - \ud83c\udf7b **Collaborate** - Shared editing support with [yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/)\\n> - \ud83d\udcbe **Clipboard** - Support copy and paste markdown, via clipboard plugin\\n> - \ud83d\udc4d **Emoji** - Support emoji shortcut and picker, via emoji plugin\\n\\n\\n\\n## SteamDeck\\n\\n2024-08-30 [mikeroyal/Steam-Deck-Guide: Steam Deck Guide.

Don\'t wait for an onboarding or major overhaul to address these problems.\\n>\\n> **Assess the trade-off you\u2019re making between quality and pace, make sure it\u2019s appropriate for your context**\\n>\\n> Evaluate the balance between speed and correctness based on the project\'s impact and environment. In non-critical applications, prioritize faster shipping and quicker fixes over exhaustive testing.\\n>\\n> **Spending time sharpening the axe is almost always worth it**\\n>\\n> Invest time in becoming proficient with your tools and environment. Learn shortcuts, become a fast typist, and know your editor and OS well. This efficiency pays off in the long run.\\n>\\n> **If you can\u2019t easily explain why something is difficult, then it\u2019s incidental complexity, which is probably worth addressing**\\n>\\n> Simplify or refactor complex code that can\'t be easily explained. This reduces future maintenance and makes your system more robust.\\n>\\n> **Try to solve bugs one layer deeper**\\n>\\n> Address the root cause of bugs rather than applying superficial fixes. This approach results in a cleaner, more maintainable system.\\n>\\n> **Don\u2019t underestimate the value of digging into history to investigate some bugs**\\n>\\n> Use version control history to trace the origin of bugs. Tools like `git bisect` can be invaluable for pinpointing changes that introduced issues.\\n>\\n> **Bad code gives you feedback, perfect code doesn\u2019t.

Using **airline engines** as an example, Hibberd illustrates how opting for fewer engines can sometimes be safer due to lower **failure probability** and fewer **knock-on effects**. The key is to control the **scope** and **consequences of failures**.\\n>\\n> > \\"We need to be resilient to failure by controlling the scope and consequences of our failure.\\"\\n>\\n> **Redundancy** and **independence** are crucial. Redundancy should be managed carefully to maintain reliability, avoiding tightly coupled systems where a single failure can cascade into multiple failures. **Service granularity** helps manage failures effectively by breaking down systems into smaller, independent services, each handling specific responsibilities and passing values around to maintain independence.\\n>\\n> > \\"Service granularity gives us this opportunity to trade the likelihood of a failure for the consequences of a failure.\\"\\n>\\n> In operations, it\'s essential to implement **health checks** and **monitoring** to detect failures early and **route around them aggressively** to prevent overload and cascading failures. Using **circuit breakers** to cut off communication to failing services allows them to recover.\\n>\\n> Designing systems with **independent services** is key. Services should operate independently, using shared values rather than shared states or dependencies. For example, an online chess service can be broken down into services for **pairing**, **playing**, **history**, and **analysis**, each maintaining independence.\\n>\\n> Operational strategies include implementing **timeouts** and **retries** to handle slow responses and prevent overloads, and deploying new versions gradually to test against real traffic and verify responses. **Proxies** can interact with unreliable code to maintain a reliable view of data.\\n>\\n> > \\"Timeouts are so important that we probably should have some sort of government-sponsored public service announcement.\\"\\n>\\n> **Handling change** in complex systems involves accommodating changes without significant disruptions through continuous deployment and rolling updates. Techniques like **in-production verification** and routing requests to both old and new versions during deployment help ensure reliability.\\n>\\n> **Data management** is also crucial. Separating data storage from application logic helps maintain reliability during changes. Avoid coupling data handling directly with services to facilitate easier updates and rollbacks.\\n>\\n> > \\"We want to create situations where we can gracefully roll things out and flatten out this time dimension.\\"\\n>\\n> Hibberd emphasizes making informed trade-offs in **architecture**, **redundancy**, and **granularity** to enhance the reliability of software systems. Continuous monitoring, strategic failure handling, and incremental deployment are essential to ensure systems remain resilient and reliable despite inevitable failures and changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd16 The Era of AI\\n\\n2024-07-01 [The limitations of LLMs, or why are we doing RAG? | EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/limitations-llm-or-why-are-we-doing-rag)\\n\\n>![image-20240806230126557](./2024-08-06-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240806230126557.png)\\n>\\n>Despite powerful capabilities with many tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) are not know-it-alls. If you\'ve used ChatGPT or other models, you\'ll have experienced how they can\u2019t reasonably answer questions about proprietary information. What\u2019s worse, it isn\u2019t just that they don\'t know about proprietary information, they are unaware of their own limitations and, even if they were aware, they don\u2019t have access to proprietary information. That\'s where options like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) come in and give LLMs the ability to incorporate new and proprietary information into their answers.\\n\\n2024-06-18 [What Is ChatGPT Doing \u2026 and Why Does It Work?\u2014Stephen Wolfram Writings](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) { writings.stephenwolfram.com }\\n\\n> ![image-20240806230337671](./2024-08-06-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240806230337671.png)\\n>\\n> **It\u2019s Just Adding One Word at a Time**\\n> That ChatGPT can automatically generate something that reads even superficially like human-written text is remarkable, and unexpected.

Burmistrov argues that this model, despite being widely adopted and powered by Open Telemetry, contributes to a state of confusion regarding its components and their respective roles in observability.\\n>\\n> Burmistrov suggests a shift towards a simpler, more unified approach to observability, advocating for the use of **Wide Events**. This concept is exemplified by Scuba, an observability system developed at Meta (formerly Facebook), which Burmistrov praises for its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to handle the exploration of data without preconceived notions about what one might find\u2014effectively addressing the challenge of **unknown unknowns**.\\n>\\n> **Key points** highlighted in the article include:\\n>\\n> - **Observability\'s Current State**: The article starts with a reflection on the confusion surrounding basic observability concepts like traces, spans, and logs, attributed partly to Open Telemetry\'s complex presentation of these concepts.\\n> - **The Concept of Wide Events**: Burmistrov introduces Wide Events as a more straightforward and flexible approach to observability. Wide Events are essentially collections of fields and values, akin to a JSON document, that encompass all relevant information about a system\'s state or event without the need for predefined structures or classifications.\\n> - **Scuba - An Observability Paradise**: The author shares his experiences with Scuba at Meta, highlighting its capability to efficiently process and analyze Wide Events. Scuba allows users to \\"slice and dice\\" data, exploring various dimensions and metrics to uncover insights about anomalies or issues within a system, all through a user-friendly interface.\\n> - **Post-Meta Observability Landscape**: Upon leaving Meta, Burmistrov expresses disappointment with the external observability tools, which seem to lack the simplicity and power of Scuba, emphasizing the industry\'s fixation on the traditional trio of metrics, logs, and traces.\\n> - **Advocacy for Wide Events**: The article argues that Wide Events can encapsulate the functionalities of traces, logs, and metrics, thereby simplifying the observability landscape. It suggests that many of the current observability practices could be more naturally and effectively addressed through Wide Events.\\n> - **Call for a Paradigm Shift**: Burmistrov calls for observability vendors to adopt and promote simpler, more intuitive systems like Wide Events. He highlights Honeycomb and Axiom as examples of platforms moving in this direction, encouraging others to follow suit to demystify observability and enhance its utility.\\n\\n2024-02-29 [Scheduling Internals](https://tontinton.com/posts/scheduling-internals/)\\n\\n> This post delves into the complex and fascinating world of **concurrency**, aiming to elucidate its mechanisms and how various programming models and languages implement it. The author seeks to demystify concurrency by answering key questions and covering topics such as the difference between concurrency and parallelism, the concept of coroutines, and the implementation of preemptive and non-preemptive schedulers. The discussion spans several programming languages and systems, including Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, and operating system internals, offering a comprehensive overview of concurrency\'s theoretical foundations and practical applications.\\n>\\n> **Concurrency vs. Parallelism**: The post distinguishes between concurrency \u2014 the ability to deal with multiple tasks at once \u2014 and parallelism \u2014 the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This distinction is crucial for understanding how systems can perform efficiently even on single-core processors by managing tasks in a way that makes them appear to run in parallel.\\n>\\n> **Threads and Async I/O**: Initially, the text explores the traditional approach of creating a thread per client for concurrent operations and quickly transitions into discussing the limitations of this method, such as the overhead of context switching and memory allocation. The narrative then shifts to asynchronous I/O operations as a more efficient alternative, highlighting non-blocking I/O and the use of event loops to manage concurrency without the heavy costs associated with threads.\\n>\\n> **Event Loops and Non-Preemptive Scheduling**: The author introduces event loops as a core concept in managing asynchronous operations, particularly in environments like Node.js, which uses libuv as its underlying library. By employing an event loop, applications can handle numerous tasks concurrently without dedicating a separate thread to each task, leading to significant performance gains and efficiency.\\n>\\n> **Preemptive Scheduling**: Moving beyond cooperative (non-preemptive) scheduling, where tasks must yield control voluntarily, the discussion turns to preemptive scheduling. This model allows the system to interrupt and resume tasks autonomously, ensuring a more equitable distribution of processing time among tasks, even if they don\'t explicitly yield control.\\n>\\n> **Coroutines and Their Implementation**: Coroutines are presented as a flexible way to handle concurrency, with the post explaining the difference between stackful and stackless coroutines. Stackful coroutines, similar to threads but more lightweight, have their own stack, allowing for traditional programming models. In contrast, stackless coroutines, used in languages like Python and Rust, break tasks into state machines and require tasks to be explicitly marked as asynchronous.\\n>\\n> **Scheduling Algorithms**: The article covers various scheduling algorithms used by operating systems and programming languages to manage task execution, including FIFO, Round Robin, and more sophisticated algorithms like those used by Linux (CFS and SCHED_DEADLINE) and Go\'s scheduler. These algorithms determine how tasks are prioritized and executed, balancing efficiency and fairness.\\n>\\n> **Multi-Core Scheduling**: Lastly, the post touches on the challenges and strategies for scheduling tasks across multiple CPU cores, including task stealing, which allows idle cores to take on work from busier ones, optimizing resource utilization and performance across the system.\\n>\\n> This comprehensive overview of concurrency aims to provide readers with a solid understanding of how modern systems achieve high levels of efficiency and responsiveness. Through detailed explanations and examples, the post illuminates the intricate mechanisms that allow software to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, whether through managing I/O operations, leveraging coroutines, or employing advanced scheduling algorithms.\\n\\n2024-03-01 [You\u2019ve just inherited a legacy C++ codebase, now what?](https://gaultier.github.io/blog/you_inherited_a_legacy_cpp_codebase_now_what.html)\\n\\n> Inheriting a legacy **C++ codebase** often feels like a daunting task, presenting a blend of complexity, idiosyncrasies, and challenges. This article delineates a strategic approach to revitalize such a codebase, focusing on minimizing effort while maximizing security, developer experience, correctness, and performance. The process emphasizes practical, incremental improvements over sweeping changes, aiming for a sustainable engineering practice.\\n>\\n> **Key Steps to Revitalize a Legacy C++ Codebase:**\\n>\\n> 1. **Initial Setup and Minimal Changes:** Start by setting up the project locally with the least amount of changes. Resist the urge for major refactorings at this stage.\\n> 2. **Trim the Fat:** Remove all unnecessary code and features that do not contribute to the core functionality your project or company advertises.\\n> 3. **Modernize the Development Process:** Integrate modern development practices like Continuous Integration (CI), linters, fuzzers, and auto-formatters to improve code quality and developer workflow.\\n> 4. **Incremental Code Improvements:** Make small, incremental changes to the codebase, ensuring it remains functional and more maintainable after each iteration.\\n> 5. **Consider a Rewrite:** If feasible, contemplate rewriting parts of the codebase in a memory-safe language to enhance security and reliability.\\n>\\n> **Strategic Considerations for Effective Management:**\\n>\\n> - **Get Buy-in:** Before diving into technical improvements, secure support from stakeholders by clearly articulating the benefits and the sustainable approach of your plan.\\n> - **Support and Documentation:** Ensure the codebase can be built and tested across all supported platforms, documenting the process to enable easy onboarding and development.\\n> - **Performance Optimization:** Identify and implement quick wins to speed up build and test times without overhauling existing systems.\\n> - **Quality Assurance Enhancements:** Adopt linters and sanitizers to catch and fix bugs early, and integrate these tools into your CI pipeline to maintain code quality.\\n> - **Code Health:** Regularly prune dead code, simplify complex constructs, and upgrade to newer C++ standards when it provides tangible benefits to the project.\\n>\\n> **Technical Insights:**\\n>\\n> - Utilize compiler warnings and tools like **cppcheck** to identify and remove unused code.\\n> - Incorporate **clang-tidy** and **cppcheck** for static code analysis, balancing thoroughness with the practicality of fixing identified issues.\\n> - Use **clang-format** to enforce a consistent coding style, minimizing diffs and merge conflicts.\\n> - Apply **sanitizers** (e.g., `-fsanitize=address,undefined`) to detect and address subtle bugs and memory leaks.\\n> - Implement a **CI pipeline** to automate testing, linting, formatting, and other checks, ensuring code quality and facilitating reproducible builds across environments.\\n\\n2024-03-07 [Making CRDTs 98% More Efficient | jakelazaroff.com](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/making-crdts-98-percent-more-efficient/)\\n\\n> This article explores the process of making Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) significantly more efficient, reducing their size by nearly 98% through a series of compression techniques. Starting from a state-based CRDT for a collaborative pixel art editor that initially required a whopping 648kb to store the state of a 100x100 image, the author demonstrates a methodical approach to compressing this data to just about 14kb. The journey to this substantial reduction involves several steps, each building upon the previous to achieve more efficient storage.\\n>\\n> **Hex Codes**: The initial step was converting RGB values to hex codes, which compacted the representation of colors from up to thirteen characters to a maximum of eight, or even five if the channel values are identical.\\n>\\n> **UUID Table**: A significant improvement came from replacing repetitive UUIDs in each pixel\'s data with indices to a central UUID table, saving considerable space due to the reduction from 38 characters per UUID to much smaller indices.\\n>\\n> **Palette Table**: Similar to the UUID table, a palette table was introduced to replace direct color values with indices, optimizing storage for images with limited color palettes.\\n>\\n> **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**: For the spatial component, RLE was applied to efficiently encode sequences of consecutive blank spaces, drastically reducing the space needed to represent unoccupied areas of the canvas.\\n>\\n> **Binary Encoding**: Transitioning from JSON to a binary format offered a major leap in efficiency. This approach utilizes bytes directly for storage, significantly compacting data representation. The binary format organizes data into chunks, each dedicated to specific parts of the state, such as UUIDs, color palettes, and pixel data.\\n>\\n> **Run-Length Binary Encoding**: The final and most significant compression came from applying run-length encoding within the binary format, further optimizing the storage of writer IDs, colors, and timestamps separately. This approach significantly reduced redundancy and exploited patterns within each category of data, ultimately achieving the goal of reducing the CRDT\'s size by 98%.\\n\\n2024-03-08 [Fundamentals of Data Visualization: 29 Telling a story and making a point](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html)\\n\\n> Effective data visualization is more than just presenting data; it\'s about telling a story that resonates with the audience. This approach bridges the gap between complex insights and audience understanding, making abstract data engaging and accessible.\\n>\\n> **Key Elements of Storytelling in Data Visualization:**\\n>\\n> - **Narrative Structure:** A well-constructed story, whether based on the Opening-Challenge-Action-Resolution format or other structures, captivates by guiding the audience from a set-up through a challenge, towards a resolution.\\n> - **Visualization Sequence:** Rather than relying on a single static image, a sequence of visualizations can more effectively convey the narrative arc, illustrating the journey from problem identification to solution.\\n> - **Clarity and Simplicity:** Visualizations should be straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity to ensure the audience can easily grasp the core message. This is akin to \\"making a figure for the generals,\\" emphasizing clear and direct communication.\\n> - **Memorability through Visual Elements:** Employing techniques like isotype plots, which use pictograms or repeated images to represent data magnitudes, can make data visualizations more memorable without sacrificing clarity.\\n> - **Diversity in Visualization:** Utilizing a variety of visualization types within a narrative helps maintain audience interest and differentiates between narrative segments, ensuring each part contributes uniquely to the overarching story.\\n> - **Progression from Raw Data to Derived Quantities:** Starting with visualizations close to the raw data establishes a foundation for understanding, onto which more abstract, derived data representations can build, highlighting key insights and trends.\\n\\n2024-03-12 [Breaking Down Tasks - Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/)\\n\\n> In a management group, someone asked for resources on teaching planning.

The text breaks down the complex topic into digestible segments, each addressing a different aspect of the authentication process, from traditional passwords to cutting-edge WebAuthn standards. It not only clarifies the distinctions between identity, authentication, and authorization but also highlights the challenges and trade-offs associated with various authentication methods. The article emphasizes the importance of choosing the right authentication strategy to balance security concerns with user experience.\\n>\\n> 1. **Authentication Basics**: Authentication is the process of verifying a user\'s identity, typically through something the user knows (like a password), owns (like a phone), or is (biometric data). The article sets the stage by explaining how critical authentication is in the digital realm, affecting both user access and system security.\\n> 2. **Knowledge-based Authentication**: This traditional method relies on passwords, PINs, or passphrases. However, it\'s fraught with challenges such as secure storage, vulnerability to attacks, and user inconvenience due to forgotten passwords. The process involves hashing passwords for secure storage, yet it\'s still vulnerable to various attacks and creates friction for users.\\n> 3. **Ownership-based Authentication**: This method involves verifying something the user owns, like an email inbox or phone number, often through one-time passwords (OTPs) or hardware like YubiKeys. Although more secure and user-friendly than knowledge-based methods, it still has drawbacks, including potential delays in OTP delivery and security concerns with SMS-based authentication.\\n> 4. **WebAuthn and Public-key Cryptography**: A modern approach to authentication, WebAuthn uses public-key cryptography to enable secure, passwordless authentication. It leverages the concept of a public/private key pair, where the private key is securely stored on the user\'s device, and the public key is shared with the service. This method significantly enhances security and user experience by eliminating passwords and reducing phishing risks.\\n> 5. **Multi-factor Authentication and Biometrics**: The article discusses how WebAuthn can be combined with biometrics or other forms of verification for multi-factor authentication, providing an additional layer of security and convenience.\\n> 6. **Cross-device Authentication Challenges**: While WebAuthn offers a streamlined authentication process, managing authentication across multiple devices presents challenges, including the risk of losing access if a device is lost.\\n> 7. **Identity-based Authentication**: This method relies on third-party identity providers like Google or Facebook to verify user identity. While convenient, it introduces the risk of access being revoked by the identity provider, highlighting the need for user-owned identity solutions.\\n>\\n> The article concludes by acknowledging the ongoing innovation in authentication technologies and the quest for secure, user-friendly methods that respect individual sovereignty. It underscores the evolving landscape of digital authentication and the importance of staying informed about these developments to ensure secure and efficient access to digital services.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Software Design\\n\\n2024-02-25 [Larger Scale Software Development (and a Big Trap) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slV0zdUEYJw)\\n\\n\\n\\n## WebComponents\\n\\n2024-03-01 [lamplightdev - Streaming HTML out of order without JavaScript](https://lamplightdev.com/blog/2024/01/10/streaming-html-out-of-order-without-javascript/)\\n\\n> This analysis explores a technique for **streaming HTML content out-of-order** using **Shadow DOM**, illustrated through a demo where an app shell is rendered first, followed by content that loads asynchronously and out of sequence.

These projects leverage WASM to run complex applications directly in the browser, eliminating the need for server-side processing and enabling powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities client-side.\\n>\\n> **9dev** shared their experience of getting sidetracked while developing a **file browser** for managing database files using the **WASM build of SQLite**. This detour led to the creation of a multi-modal **CSV file editor** capable of displaying CSV files as sortable tables, powered by a streaming, web worker-based parser.\\n>\\n> **Simonw** discussed utilizing a WASM build of **Python** and SQLite to run the **Datasette server-side web application** entirely in the browser. This setup allows executing SQL queries against data files, such as a parquet file containing **AWS edge locations**, demonstrating a novel approach to processing and analyzing data client-side.\\n>\\n> **Tobilg** introduced the **SQL Workbench**, built on **DuckDB WASM**, **Perspective.js**, and **React**, supporting queries on remote and local data (Parquet, CSV, JSON), data visualizations, and sharing of queries via URL. A tutorial blog post was mentioned for guidance on common usage patterns, signaling a resource for developers interested in in-browser data engineering.\\n>\\n> The discussion also touched on **Perspective.js**, highlighted by **paddy_m** as a powerful and fast table library primarily used in finance, and **dav43**, who integrated it into **datasette.io** as a plugin to handle large datasets.

It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don\'t have to answer so many questions about it.\\n> 2. \ud83d\udc8e **Impatience**: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don\'t just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.\\n> 3. \ud83d\udc8e **Hubris**: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won\'t want to say bad things about.\\n\\n2024-02-06 [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev/)\\n\\n> An open-source guide to help you write better command-line programs, taking traditional UNIX principles and updating them for the modern day.\\n\\n2024-02-08 [A Distributed Systems Reading List](https://ferd.ca/a-distributed-systems-reading-list.html)\\n\\n> This document, curated by Fred Hebert in 2019 and later updated, serves as a comprehensive reading list and primer on distributed systems.

The post is aimed at anyone planning to write HTTP services in Go, from beginners to experienced developers, highlighting the shift in Mat\'s practices over time and emphasizing testing, structuring, and handling services for maintainability and efficiency.\\n>\\n> **Key Takeaways and Practices:**\\n>\\n> 1. **Server Construction with `NewServer`**:\\n>\\n> - **Approach**: The `NewServer` function is central, taking all dependencies as arguments to return an `http.Handler`, ensuring clear dependency management and setup of middleware for common tasks like CORS and authentication.\\n\\n```go\\n  func NewServer(logger *Logger, config *Config, commentStore *commentStore) http.Handler {\\n    mux := http.NewServeMux()\\n    // Configuration and middleware setup\\n    return handler\\n  }\\n```\\n\\n> **Routing with `routes.go`**:\\n>\\n> - **Purpose**: Centralizes API route definitions, making it easy to see the service\'s API surface and ensuring that route setup is consistent and manageable.\\n> - **Implementation Strategy**: Dependencies are explicitly passed to handlers, maintaining type safety and clarity in handler dependencies.\\n>\\n> **Simplified `main` Function**:\\n>\\n> - **Design**: Encapsulates the application\'s entry point, focusing on setup and graceful shutdown, facilitated by a `run` function that encapsulates starting the server and handling OS signals.\\n\\n```go\\n  func main() {\\n    if err := run(); err != nil {\\n      // Handle error\\n    }\\n  }\\n```\\n\\n> **Middleware and Handler Patterns**:\\n>\\n> - **Middleware**: Adopts the adapter pattern for middleware, allowing pre- and post-processing around handlers for concerns like authorization, without cluttering handler logic.\\n> - **Handlers**: Emphasizes returning `http.Handler` from functions, allowing for initialization and setup to be done within the handler\'s closure for isolation and reusability.\\n>\\n> **Error Handling and Validation**:\\n>\\n> - **Strategy**: Uses detailed error handling and validation within handlers and middleware, ensuring robustness and reliability of the service by catching and properly managing errors.\\n>\\n> **Testing**:\\n>\\n> - **Philosophy**: Prioritizes comprehensive testing, covering unit to integration tests, to ensure code reliability and ease of maintenance. The structure of the codebase, particularly the use of `run` function, facilitates testing by mimicking real-world operation.\\n>\\n> **Performance Considerations**:\\n>\\n> - **Optimizations**: Includes strategies for optimizing service performance, such as deferring expensive setup until necessary (using `sync.Once` for lazily initializing components) and ensuring quick startup and graceful shutdown for better resource management.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Linux\\n\\n2024-02-15 [systemd by example - Part 1: Minimization - Sebastian Jambor\'s blog](https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/systemd-by-example-part-1-minimization/)\\n\\n> Jambor shares his journey to understand systemd, a crucial system and service manager for Linux, by starting with the simplest setup possible and gradually adding complexity. The post encourages hands-on experimentation by running systemd in a container, avoiding risks to the host system.\\n>\\n> The article concludes with a functioning, minimal systemd setup comprised of six unit files.

These are questions of the form *\u201cTell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?\u201d*. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. In the past, I have failed interviews because of these questions \u2013 I hadn\u2019t prepared, and couldn\u2019t come up with good examples on the spot in the interviews.\\n>\\n> This time I went through a good list of such questions ([Rock the Behavioral Interview](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leapai/)) from Leetcode, and thought about examples to use. Once I had good examples, I wrote the question and my answer down in the document. Before an interview, I would review what I had written down, so I would be able to come up with good examples. This worked well, I didn\u2019t fail any interviews because of behavioral questions.\\n>\\n> In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. I tried to cover many common patterns and idioms. I did this so I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn\u2019t made any mistake, and included relevant output.

They provide the means to store, search, and modify data residing at various levels of the storage and memory hierarchy, from durable storage (spinning disks, solid state disks, and other non-volatile memories) to random access memory, caches, and registers. Designing efficient data structures for given workloads has long been a focus of research and practice in both academia and industry. This book outlines the underlying design dimensions of data structures and shows how they can be combined to support (or fail to support) various workloads. The book further shows how these design dimensions can lead to an understanding of the behavior of individual state-of-the-art data structures and their hybrids. Finally, this systematization of the design space and the accompanying guidelines will enable you to select the most fitting data structure or even to invent an entirely new data structure for a given workload.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Seattle \\n\\n2024-02-09 \ud83c\udf0e [nearbywiki Fairview Avenue North Bridge](https://en.nearbywiki.org/map/discover/62994596#15/47.6191/-122.3258)\\n\\n> Explore interesting places nearby listed on Wikipedia\\n\\n\\n\\n## Ideas\\n\\n2024-02-24 [Tommy\'s inclusive datepicker](https://fymmot.github.io/inclusive-dates/)\\n\\n2024-02-06 [Kaptr.me - Capture, share and save data with live screenshots of any app or website](https://kaptr.me/)\\n\\n2024-02-07 [Web based logs viewer UI for local development environment | Logdy](https://logdy.dev/blog/post/web-based-logs-viewer-ui-for-local-development-environment)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Dark Souls 2\\n\\n2024-02-01 \ud83d\udccc [Some more translated DS2 Kouryakubo Maps (WIP, edited for SotFS) : DarkSouls2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/apav5b/some_more_translated_ds2_kouryakubo_maps_wip/)\\n\\n> JP Kouryakubo Maps http://www.kouryakubo.com/darksouls2/index.html\\n\\n2024-02-12 [Dark Souls 2 Design Works : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/dark-souls-2-design-works/page/n55/mode/2up)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Bigdata\\n\\n2024-01-31 [timeplus-io/proton: A streaming SQL engine, a fast and lightweight alternative to Apache Flink, \ud83d\ude80 powered by ClickHouse.](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton)\\n\\n\\n\\n## CSS (Research)\\n\\n2024-02-16 [sass/sass: Sass makes CSS fun!](https://github.com/sass/sass)\\n\\n2024-02-16 \ud83d\udcb2\ud83d\udcfa [Creating a Living Style Guide with Sass and Vanilla JavaScript | Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-living-style-guide-sass-vanilla-javascript/table-of-contents)\\n\\n2024-02-16 [Atomic Design Methodology | Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)\\n\\n2024-02-20 [You Might Not Need Sass: Modern CSS Techniques](https://mjswensen.com/blog/you-might-not-need-sass-modern-css-techniques/)\\n\\n2024-02-21 [Stepping away from Sass](https://cathydutton.co.uk/posts/why-i-stopped-using-sass/)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Web Dev Stuff\\n\\n2024-01-28 [In Loving Memory of Square Checkbox @ tonsky.me](https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/)\\n\\n2024-01-30 \u2b50  [Web Components in Earnest](https://naildrivin5.com/blog/2024/01/24/web-components-in-earnest.html)\\n\\n> Found in: 2024-01-30 [JavaScript Weekly Issue 672: January 25, 2024](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/672)\\n\\n2024-01-30 [How to start a React Project in 2024](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-starter/)\\n\\n> Found in: 2024-01-30 [JavaScript Weekly Issue 672: January 25, 2024](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/672)\\n\\n2024-01-30  [pretty-ms 9.0: Convert Milliseconds to Readable Strings](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/150535/ccd9409267) \u2014 `1337000000` \u2192 `15d 11h 23m 20s`\\n\\n> Found in: 2024-01-30 [JavaScript Weekly Issue 672: January 25, 2024](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/672)\\n\\n2024-01-30 [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/)\\n\\n> Found in: 2024-01-30 [JavaScript Weekly Issue 672: January 25, 2024](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/672)\\n> A language for concisely describing cloud service APIs and generating other API description languages (e.g. OpenAPI), client and service code, docs, and more.

Let\'s consider an example scenario where we want to build a quiz app and generate a list of quiz questions using GPT API. Before function, we would have to ask the model to respond in a certain format, and manually parse the output. By leveraging function calling, we can ensure that the generated output is consistent.\\n>\\n> Here\'s an example code snippet in TypeScript that demonstrates how to achieve this { ... code ...}\\n\\n```js\\n// Make the API request with function calling\\nconst res = await openai.createChatCompletion({\\n  // Use \\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\\" or \\"gpt-4-0613\\" models for function calling\\n  model: \\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\\",\\n  functions,\\n  // Force the result to be a function call\\n  function_call: { name: \\"generateQuiz\\" },\\n  messages,\\n});\\n\\n// Extract the function arguments from the API response and parse them\\nconst args = res.data.choices[0].message?.function_call?.arguments || \\"\\";\\nconst result = JSON.parse(args);\\nconsole.log(result);\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n2024-01-02 [Creating a Calculator App](https://darylrodrigo.notion.site/Creating-a-Calculator-App-79b4593ee6044b9ab2bdfb94641b282e)\\n\\n- 2024-02-09 [Building a Typescript Version of Auto-GPT: Implementation and Findings](https://darylrodrigo.notion.site/Building-a-Typescript-Version-of-Auto-GPT-Implementation-and-Findings-3a4d30fc6e8c48329ad03ab3f7a4aeed)\\n\\n> ![image-20240208183145917](./2024-02-08-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240208183145917.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd12 Security\\n\\n2024-02-09 [Technology-best-practices/it_security/server_security/README.md at master \xb7 vaquarkhan/Technology-best-practices \xb7 GitHub](https://github.com/vaquarkhan/Technology-best-practices/blob/master/it_security/server_security/README.md)\\n\\n> ![image-20240208170915828](./2024-02-08-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20240208170915828.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Bi-i-i-g Emacs link dump, no comments \ud83d\udc08\ud83d\udca8\\n\\n> Perfect `init.el` is the work of my entire life!\\n\\n2023-12-10 [Fuzzy Finding with Emacs Instead of fzf - Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/fuzzy-finding-emacs-instead-of-fzf)\\n\\n2024-02-06 [The Absolute Beginner\u2019s Guide to Emacs - System Crafters](https://systemcrafters.net/emacs-essentials/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/)\\n\\n2023-12-25 [ashok-khanna/lisp-notes: Repo for Common Lisp by Example and all other useful resources I found online](https://github.com/ashok-khanna/lisp-notes)\\n\\n2023-12-20 [Improving Emacs isearch Usability with Transient](http://yummymelon.com/devnull/improving-emacs-isearch-usability-with-transient.html)\\n\\n2023-08-27 [Emacs Elements - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@emacselements/videos)\\n2023-09-05 [emacs-bedrock: Stepping stones to a better Emacs experience](https://sr.ht/~ashton314/emacs-bedrock/)\\n\\n> From HN comments:\\n> Treesitter is baked in for syntax, eglot is baked in for language servers (intellisense), project and tab-bar give you scoped workspaces. use-package is baked in for downloading and configuring dependencies.\\n>\\n> Modus-themes are also built in now, so you can use modus-operandi and modus-vivendi out of the box.

This approach ensures better quality assurance and refactoring resistance, despite potential increases in execution time. Parallel testing can mitigate this issue.\\n> > 2. **Avoid Over-Isolating Code in Tests**: Testing code in isolation can make tests fragile and less useful during refactoring. Use patterns like hexagonal architecture for better decoupling and consider using real databases for more meaningful tests. Over-isolation can render test coverage reports less informative about the system\'s overall functionality.\\n> > 3. **Adhere to TDD Principles**: In Test-Driven Development (TDD), only write new code when there is a failing test, ensuring the effectiveness of tests and comprehensive scenario coverage. Avoid using mocks/stubs to reach 100% test coverage; instead, use realistic API scenarios. This principle may not apply during refactoring.\\n> > 4. **TDD and Software Design**: The concept that TDD drives software design is not universally applicable. Non-functional requirements, often not addressed in unit testing, play a crucial role in defining software architecture.\\n>\\n> 2023-12-26 [An Interactive Intro to CRDTs | jakelazaroff.com](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/)\\n>\\n> > What is a CRDT?\\n> > Okay, let\u2019s start from the top. CRDT stands for \u201cConflict-free Replicated Data Type\u201d. That\u2019s a long acronym, but the concept isn\u2019t too complicated. It\u2019s a kind of data structure that can be stored on different computers (peers). Each peer can update its own state instantly, without a network request to check with other peers. Peers may have different states at different points in time, but are guaranteed to eventually converge on a single agreed-upon state. That makes CRDTs great for building rich collaborative apps, like Google Docs and Figma \u2014 without requiring a central server to sync changes.\\n> >\\n> > ![image-20231227121814572](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227121814572.png)\\n>\\n> 2023-12-26 [Main Content \u2013 Math \u2229 Programming](https://jeremykun.com/main-content/)\\n> ![image-20231226140745106](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231226140745106.png)\\n>\\n> 2023-12-26 [Query Engines: Push vs. Pull](https://justinjaffray.com/query-engines-push-vs.-pull/)\\n>\\n> ![image-20231227122404096](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227122404096.png)\\n>\\n> 2023-12-26 [How Levels.fyi scaled to millions of users with Google Sheets as a backend](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/scaling-to-millions-with-google-sheets.html)\\n>\\n> ![image-20231227122509881](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227122509881.png)\\n>\\n> 2023-12-26 [Justine Tunney\'s Web Page](https://justine.lol/)\\n>\\n> ![image-20231227122601507](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227122601507.png)\\n\\n2023-12-23 [a blog by biggiemac42](https://biggieblog.com/celebrating-the-first-nes-tetris-game-crash/) \\n\\n> ![image-20231227125547011](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227125547011.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddb9 Cheat sheets\\n\\n2023-11-23 [Input Validation - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\\n\\n> Introduction\\n> This article is focused on providing clear, simple, actionable guidance for providing Input Validation security functionality in your applications.\\n>\\n> Goals of Input Validation\\n> Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from persisting in the database and triggering malfunction of various downstream components. Input validation should happen as early as possible in the data flow, preferably as soon as the data is received from the external party.\\n>\\n> Data from all potentially untrusted sources should be subject to input validation, including not only Internet-facing web clients but also backend feeds over extranets, from suppliers, partners, vendors or regulators, each of which may be compromised on their own and start sending malformed data.\\n>\\n> Input Validation should not be used as the primary method of preventing XSS, SQL Injection and other attacks which are covered in respective cheat sheets but can significantly contribute to reducing their impact if implemented properly.\\n>\\n> ![image-20231227124046013](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227124046013.png)\\n\\n2023-11-23 [ChatGPT Prompting Cheat Sheet : ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14ccjcw/chatgpt_prompting_cheat_sheet/)\\n\\n> ![image-20231227124908917](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227124908917.png)\\n\\n> ![image-20231227124943187](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227124943187.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Testing and Validation\\n\\n2023-11-23 [Validate all the things: improve your security with input validation! - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-03-21-validate-all-things-input-validation/)\\n\\n> ![image-20231227124326228](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227124326228.png)\\n\\n2023-11-25 [Delivering Safe C++ - Bjarne Stroustrup - CppCon 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8UvQKvOSSw)\\n\\n> Being careful does not scale.

I\'ve known about aliases for a while but only recently began using them. Below are some aliases I\'ve set up permanently in my .bashrc config. Aliases must be set up in the format of \'alias [name]=\'[command]\' and saved into .bashrc in the home folder. For example, `alias music=\'cmus\'` will launch cmus whenever I enter \'music\' into my terminal.\\n>\\n> Here is a list of aliases I\'ve set up that range from fun to boring, but are all useful nonetheless. Entering the alias in a terminal will automatically run the corresponding command.\\n>\\n> - Alias: `weather`\\n>   Command: `curl wttr.in/austin`\\n>   Purpose: spits out what the weather is in Austin TX (or whichever city you specify).\\n> - Alias: `define`\\n>   Command: `sdcv`\\n>   Purpose: I [wrote a post](https://chuck.is/dictionary) about this one. Typing \'define\' followed by a word will output that word\'s definition.\\n> - Alias: `flac2ogg`\\n>   Command: `find . -name \\"*flac\\" -exec oggenc -q 9 {} \\\\;`\\n>   Purpose: When I buy music off of Bandcamp, I download the FLAC version and then convert it to OGG. BC does offer OGG, but it\'s in a lower quality than I prefer\\n> - Alias: `wifi`\\n>   Command: `nmcli dev wifi show-password`\\n>   Purpose: Typing this outputs the wifi password of the network I\'m currently connected to, as well as provides a useful QR code.\\n> - Alias: `unmountBackup`\\n>   Command: `umount /run/media/chuck/Backup` Purpose: I often mount and unmount my external drive. Typing \\"unm\\" then tabbing will autocomplete \'unmountBackup\', so I don\'t have to type out the entire path every time.\\n> - Alias: `ddg`\\n>   Command: `w3m lite.duckduckgo.com`\\n>   Purpose: This brings up the light version of Duck Duck Go in w3m so I can do web searches right from a terminal window.\\n> - Alias: `rm`\\n>   Command: `rm -r`\\n>   Purpose: Because when I type \\"rm\\" I don\'t want to always have to specify \\"-r\\" for a directory.\\n> - Alias: `cp`\\n>   Command: `cp -r`\\n>   Purpose: Same as above. When I say \\"copy this\\" I always want it to copy whatever I\'m specifying, even if it\'s a directory.\\n> - Alias: `rss`\\n>   Command: `newsboat`\\n>   Purpose: A shorter way to start up newsboat (an even quicker way is setting a keyboard shortcut to Super+N)\\n> - Alias: `vpn`\\n>   Command: `protonvpn-cli`\\n>   Purpose: Just a shorter way to start up ProtonVPN\'s CLI tool so I can type things like \'vpn -r\' instead of \'protonvpn -r\'\\n\\n\\n\\n## No Ads!\\n\\n2023-12-05 [anfragment/zen: Simple, free and efficient ad-blocker and privacy guard for Windows, MacOS and Linux](https://github.com/anfragment/zen)\\n\\n> Zen is an open-source system-wide ad-blocker and privacy guard for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The descendant:: selector scopes the search to each post as found above.\\n> - **Item content:** `descendant::p[3]`\\n>   Beverley\u2019s static site generator template puts the post summary in the third paragraph of the `<li>`, which we can select like this.\\n> - **Item link:** `descendant::h2/a/@href`\\n>   This expects a URL, so we need the /@href to make sure we get the *value* of the `<h2><a href=\\"...\\">`, rather than its *contents*.\\n> - **Item thumbnail:** `descendant::img[@class=\\"blog__image--preview\\"]/@src`\\n>   Again, this expects a URL, which we get from the `<img src=\\"...\\">`.\\n> - **Item author:** `\\"Beverley Newing\\"`\\n>   Beverley\u2019s blog doesn\u2019t host any guest posts, so I just use a string literal here.\\n> - **Item date:** `substring-after(descendant::p[@class=\\"blog__date-posted\\"], \\"Date posted: \\")`\\n>   This is the only complicated one: the published dates on Beverley\u2019s blog aren\u2019t explicitly marked-up, but part of a string that begins with the words \u201cDate posted: \u201c, so I use XPath\u2019s [`substring-after`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/substring-after) function to strtip this. The result gets passed to PHP\u2019s [`strtotime()`](https://www.php.net/strtotime), which is pretty tolerant of different date formats (although not of the words \u201cDate posted:\u201d it turns out!).\\n>\\n> ![image-20231227123019166](./2023-12-25-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231227123019166.png)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [Athou/commafeed: Google Reader inspired self-hosted RSS reader.](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [nkanaev/yarr: yet another rss reader](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [stringer-rss/stringer: A self-hosted, anti-social RSS reader.](https://github.com/stringer-rss/stringer)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [nextcloud/news: :newspaper: RSS/Atom feed reader](https://github.com/nextcloud/news)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [yang991178/fluent-reader: Modern desktop RSS reader built with Electron, React, and Fluent UI](https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [fossar/selfoss: multipurpose rss reader, live stream, mashup, aggregation web application](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [googlearchive/wReader-app: RSS Reader written using AngularJS](https://github.com/googlearchive/wReader-app)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [davidsun/EasyRSS: Google Reader Client for Android](https://github.com/davidsun/EasyRSS)\\n\\n2023-12-21 [lwindolf/liferea: Liferea (Linux Feed Reader), a news reader for GTK/GNOME](https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Web Scrapping\\n\\n2023-12-21 [RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge: The RSS feed for websites missing it](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge)"},{"id":"/2023/12/15/links-from-my-inbox","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/12/15/links-from-my-inbox","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2023-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.md","title":"Links from my inbox 2023-12-15","description":"e1e70d08-c84f-419d-9681-42b55f70736c","date":"2023-12-15T21:38:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 15, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":15.495,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox 2023-12-15","date":"2023-12-15T21:38:00.000Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2023-12-25","permalink":"/blog/2023/12/25/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2023-11-03","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/03/links-from-my-inbox"}},"content":"![e1e70d08-c84f-419d-9681-42b55f70736c](./2023-12-15-links-from-my-inbox.assets/e1e70d08-c84f-419d-9681-42b55f70736c.webp)\\n\\n> A wide, atmospheric, and realistic 3D rendered image of a decrepit room in a Silent Hill setting, featuring an old, bulky CRT computer. The computer sits on a heavy, worn wooden desk, the screen flickering with static and displaying cryptic, glitched messages that seem to come from another world. The walls of the room are peeling and stained, and the only light comes from the eerie, unnatural glow of the computer screen, which casts long, sinister shadows. Cobwebs stretch from the corners of the room to the ancient machine, and the air is thick with the smell of mold and electronic burning. The atmosphere is dense with a sense of abandonment and horror, with every detail from the dusty keyboard to the murky, cracked window contributing to the chilling scene.\\n\\n\\n\\n[[_TOC_]]\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Good Reads\\n\\n2023-08-14 [Nobody ever paid me for code - Bite code!](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/nobody-ever-paid-me-for-code)\\n\\n> Examples of what not so say and what to say instead.\\n>\\n> Don\'t:\\n>\\n> > We should migrate from SQLite to Postgress.

It might sound appealing at first \u2014 *I can work on anything, the biggest ideas*! But it\u2019s usually unnecessarily difficult, and less likely to hit the sweet spot of topics and timing when not anchored in existing critical needs. For managers, this means starting with a rough role scope and top problems in mind, rather than starting with a generic senior IC and hoping they\u2019ll figure out something great to do.\\n> - Managers leaving senior IC roles out of organizational planning. Ideally, org plans include senior IC roles: Where are they most needed? How do they fit into the org\u2019s leadership team? Is the intention to grow existing ICs into them vs. bring new senior ICs in? Being explicit about these helps ICs understand needs and opportunities for themselves.\\n> - ICs fearing failure, or failing slowly. Senior roles come with a necessary risk of failure. It can be tempting to avoid or minimize that risk altogether \u2014 only taking on what\u2019s simpler or certain \u2014 but that comes with opportunity costs. On the other hand, trying too long on a failed approach isn\u2019t good either. Ways to address these include timeboxing big bet projects, breaking large projects into milestones, recognizing \u201cgood failures,\u201d debriefing on failures (and successes!), and developing a culture that supports healthy risks.\\n\\n2023-12-08 [Goodbye, Clean Code \u2014 overreacted](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/)\\n\\n> Clean code is not an objective metric, but a subjective preference that can vary depending on the context and the goals of the project.\\n> Removing duplication and creating abstractions can have unintended consequences, such as making the code more rigid, complex, and difficult to understand and change.\\n> Coding is a journey of learning and discovery, and developers should be open to different perspectives and approaches, and not be dogmatic or judgmental about code quality1\\n\\n\\n\\n## \u2049 How the things work\\n\\n2023-11-05 [A Complete Guide to UUID Versions (v1, v4, v5) - With Examples](https://www.sohamkamani.com/uuid-versions-explained/)\\n\\n> This post will describe UUID v1, v4, and v5, with examples.

Steam-powered ships could decide the fate of world affairs, a fact that shaped empires around the demands of steam, and that made Britain the peerless powerof the age. But steam created or extended commercial and cultural networks as well as military and political ones. Faster communication and transportation allowed imperial centers to more easily project power, but it also allowed goods and ideas to flow more easily along the same links. Arguably, it was more often commercial than imperial interests that drove the building of steamships, the sinking of cables and the laying of rail, although in many cases the two interests were so entangled that they can hardly be separated: the primary attraction of an empire, after all (other than prestige) lay in the material advantages to be extracted from the conquered territories.\\n> ![image-20231103184531226](./2023-11-03-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231103184531226.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Good Videos\\n\\n2023-10-06 [New talk: Making Hard Things Easy](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/10/06/new-talk--making-hard-things-easy/)\\n\\n> ![image-20231103184731764](./2023-11-03-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231103184731764.png)\\n\\n2023-10-04 [Iron Man or Ultron: Is AI here to help us or hurt us? - Scott Hanselman - Copenhagen DevFest 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDVKl-27g9M)\\n\\n> Luck = Hard Work + Opportunity\\n> Stupid = uninformed\\n>\\n> ![image-20231103185244798](./2023-11-03-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231103185244798.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Retro\\n\\n2023-10-12 [Why does Outlook map Ctrl+F to Forward instead of Find, like all right-thinking programs? - The Old New Thing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140715-00/?p=503)\\n\\n> The reason is -- Bill Gates\\n>\\n> ![image-20231103181103783](./2023-11-03-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231103181103783.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## C and C++\\n\\n2023-10-29 [fffaraz/awesome-cpp ](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp)\\n\\n> A curated list of awesome C++ (or C) frameworks, libraries, resources, and shiny things.

Often you can guess the meaning from its context but if you can\'t, it\'s really useful to be able to get it without having to leave the story.\\n>\\n> - Ability to adjust the level of the short story (beginner, mid, advanced).\\n>\\n> - The stories should be available everywhere; no need to carry a book around. I probably won\'t be able to use the book in the office.\\n>\\n> - Have a mentor available 24x7 that can answer any question about grammar or about the story.\\n>\\n> - I want to test my understanding at the end of the short story with questions. Bonus points if someone checks my answers for correctness.\\n>\\n> - Include audio to hear the pronunciation and sounds of the language.\\n\\n2023-10-11 [Building a 42-inch E Ink Art Frame](https://eliot.blog/e-ink-frame)\\n\\n> ![image-20231103181740673](./2023-11-03-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20231103181740673.png)\\n>\\n> ![](https://a.storyblok.com/f/200844/255x455/e5ad35df44/img_4990.gif)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Mocks & Stubs\\n\\n2023-10-13 [How to Mock the File System for Unit Testing in .NET - Code Maze](https://code-maze.com/dotnet-unit-testing-mock-file-system/)\\n\\n> Why Is Unit-Testing the File System Methods Complex?\\n> Let\u2019s imagine we have a method that reads the content of a file and writes the number of its lines, words, and bytes in a new file.

The reality is that time is constantly moving against us, and when unexpected things happen they can take an order of magnitude longer than we planned.

Give a best effort, and keep your stakeholders informed of progress and blockers.\\n>\\n> **Aggressively manage scope.** Related to the above, protect your project\u2019s scope. Defensively, as people will often try to add things throughout the project. You don\u2019t have to push back if you don\u2019t want, but be transparent about how it will affect the project delivery and communicate it widely.

The coordinator also gets rid of nondeterminism sources like random or time by filling in those values. The oplogs then get sent to the workers that execute them and materialize the values.

It is found in nearly every smartphone (iOS and Android), computer, web browser, television, and automobile. There are likely over one trillion SQLite databases in active use. (If you are on a Mac laptop, you can open a terminal, type \\"sqlite3\\", and start conversing with the SQLite database engine using SQL.)\\n> SQLite is a single node and (mostly) single threaded online transaction processing (OLTP) database. It has an in-process/embbedded design, and a standalone (no dependencies) codebase ...a single C library consisting of 150K lines of code.  With all features enabled, the compiled library size can be less than 750 KiB. Yet, SQLite can support tens of thousands of transactions per second. Due to its reliability, SQLite is used in mission-critical applications such as flight software. There are over 600 lines of test code for every line of code in SQLite. SQLite is truly the little database engine that could.\\n\\n- [Warp: Lightweight Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/05/warp-lightweight-multi-key-transactions.html)\\n\\n> This paper introduces a simple yet powerful idea to provide efficient multi-key transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded NoSQL data store. The Warp protocol prevents serializability cycles forming between concurrent transactions by forcing them to serialize via a chain communication pattern rather than using a parallel 2PC fan-out/fan-in communication. This avoids hotspots associated with fan-out/fan-in communication and prevents wasted parallel work from contacting multiple other servers when traversing them in serial would surface an invalidation/abortion early on in the serialization.

We created a source code repository in Git and configured a CI/CD pipeline for it in GitLab. We integrated the pipeline to push code coverage metrics to CodeCov.io and implemented unit and integration tests to achieve a high level of coverage. In our unit tests, we experimented with object mocking techniques. In the integration test we generated a sample data set and registered it as a table with SparkSession. We enabled Spark integration with Hive in order to allow the test to write transformed data to a Hive table backed by the local file system. In the next article we will continue this exploration by implementing a data conversion for a practical use case.\\n\\n2023-08-26 [Spark Partitioning & Partition Understanding - Spark By {Examples}](https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/spark-partitioning-understanding/)\\n\\n> FREE ADS!\\n\\n2023-07-05 [Our journey at F5 with Apache Arrow (part 2): Adaptive Schemas and Sorting to Optimize Arrow Usage | Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2023/06/26/our-journey-at-f5-with-apache-arrow-part-2/)\\n\\n2023-08-05 [Introduction \xb7 The Internals of Apache Spark](https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/content/)\\n\\n2023-08-05 [GitHub - awesome-spark/spark-gotchas: Spark Gotchas.

Their focus stays on accountable results and this person can bring resolution and closure together.\\n>  - *Expert*: They are sought after to be in meetings, for instance, so that good decisions can be made.\\n>  - *Results-focused*: they are focused on getting great results and don\'t entwine their ego to particular solutions. They don\'t get defensive if their ideas are revealed to have flaws but rather delight in being able to move to a better solution.\\n>  - *Leadership*: pro-active leadership that convinces team members of the future direction and even helps to implement it. This is a big difference between those who can complain about the way things should be and those you can actually bring it about.\\n>  - *Solutions, not problems*: following up on the above, they aren\'t complaining about problems on the team but rather implementing and driving solutions.\\n>  - *Makes other great*: the team benefits and grows from the person\'s contributions. Answers questions from the team, from support, from customers. Knows what the team delivers backwards and forwards. They are a good mentor.\\n>  - *Influence when they can, scare when they must*: they have fundamental skills in influencing people, but if they need to flip into junk-yard dog mode, they can. They don\'t give up and walk away but rather fight when they need to fight, escalating only when needed and with lots of justification.\\n>  - *Makes the boss great:* if the team and your boss are succeeding because of you, of course you\'ll be succeeding too.\\n>  - *Not doing it for the promotion*: if you\'re out for a promotion, don\'t do work specifically chose to get the promotion. This is like meeting the Buddha on the road. If you come up with a pretty plan to justify your promotion, you\'ve already lost it. Such plotting is obvious and actually detrimental to your career.

The caveat here is that you need to spend a lot of time learning and mastering the tools; only then will the tools help you. It is a gradual everyday process rather than one-day learning.  \\n>\\n> - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learning the keyboard shortcuts for your favorite IDE or editor, as well as for your operating system, can significantly speed up your workflow. These become automatic over time, allowing you to perform complex actions without thinking.\\n>\\n> - **Code Syntax**: Familiarity with the syntax of the language you\'re working in makes writing code a lot smoother. It becomes a low-level skill when you no longer have to think about the basic structure of loops, conditionals, etc., and can focus on the logic you\'re implementing.\\n>\\n> - **Testing Frameworks**: If you\'re using automated testing (and you should be), learning your testing framework inside and out enables you to quickly write and run tests without having to stop and think about how to do it. This enhances your ability to perform TDD (Test Driven Development) or other testing methodologies without a hitch.\\n>\\n> - **Debugging Techniques**: Understanding the ins and outs of your debugging tools and how to quickly diagnose common problems in your code can become a low-level skill. Knowing how to efficiently use breakpoints, inspect variables, and utilize other debugging features saves a lot of time.\\n>\\n> - **Git Commands**: If you\'re using Git or a similar version control system, becoming fluent in common commands enables you to manage your codebase efficiently. Committing, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts can become automatic processes.\\n>\\n> - **Touch Typing**: This is a fundamental skill for any professional who spends a significant amount of time on a computer. Being able to type without looking at the keys allows your thoughts to flow directly onto the screen, greatly enhancing your efficiency.\\n>\\n> - **Use of Snippets and Templates**: Many editors and IDEs allow you to define snippets or templates for code that you write frequently. This could be something as simple as the boilerplate for a class definition or as complex as a full file template. Being adept at using these can save a lot of time and effort.\\n>\\n> - **Build Tools and Automation**: Understanding how to automate repetitive tasks using build tools, scripts, and other automation techniques is a vital low-level skill. It allows you to focus on the higher-level aspects of your work, knowing that the lower-level tasks are handled efficiently.\\n>\\n> By turning these into automatic processes, you free up cognitive resources to focus on higher-level problem-solving and decision-making. It can be highly beneficial to invest the time and effort into mastering these low-level skills, as they\'ll pay off in the long run by enhancing your efficiency, reducing mistakes, and allowing you to produce better-quality code more quickly.\\n>\\n> A good practice for developing these skills is to identify areas where you feel you are slowing down or getting stuck frequently and deliberately practice those specific tasks until they become second nature. Whether it\'s through deliberate practice, reading documentation, or seeking tutorials and guidance, investing in these low-level skills will have long-lasting benefits in your coding career.\\n\\n2023-08-08 [Articles For Beginning Cyclists](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/beginners.html) \ud83d\udeb4\ud83d\udeb5\ud83d\udeb5\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udeb5\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\n\\n> Everything You Wanted To Know About Shifting Your Bicycle\'s Gears,\\n> But Were Afraid To Ask.\\n> This is an introduction to gear shifting, and the basics of how a derailer works.

Here\'s an overview:\\n\\n1. **JAR (JWT-Secured Authorization Request):**\\n   - **Description**: JAR is a method to secure OAuth 2.0 authorization requests using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This allows the client to send requests in a way that ensures integrity and possibly confidentiality of the authorization request parameters.\\n   - **Use**: It\'s used to protect the content of the authorization request, thus increasing the security of the OAuth 2.0 flow.\\n\\n2. **PAR (Pushed Authorization Request):**\\n   - **Description**: PAR enables the client to request authorization from the authorization server without exposing the parameters to the end-user\'s user-agent. It essentially allows the parameters to be sent directly to the authorization server, returning a URL that the user-agent can be redirected to.\\n   - **Use**: This enhances the security of the OAuth 2.0 authorization process by reducing exposure of sensitive parameters to possibly malicious user-agents or intermediaries.\\n\\n3. **RAR (Rich Authorization Requests):**\\n   - **Description**: RAR is an extension to OAuth 2.0 that provides a way for clients to convey a fine-grained authorization request, using a structured format, both for scope and other authorization parameters.\\n   - **Use**: This allows for a more detailed and flexible authorization request, suitable for various complex use cases that require more than the basic scopes.\\n\\n4. **FAPI2 (Financial-grade API Part 2 - Advanced Financial-grade API):**\\n   - **Description**: FAPI2 is a set of security profiles for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, designed for high-risk scenarios like financial services and payments. It specifies various security requirements and recommendations to ensure that the authorization process is highly secure.\\n   - **Use**: It\'s used to provide robust security measures specifically for financial APIs, where high levels of security are needed.\\n\\nIn summary, these terms are all related to enhancing and extending the security and functionality of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, particularly in scenarios that require high levels of security, such as in financial services.\\n\\n\\n2023-08-06 [OAuth and the long way to Proof of Possession - Dominick Baier & Steinar Noem - NDC Security 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkigVNNSurI&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGey4D3-wb_2SWTmLJtGHC_j)\\n- 2023-08-06 [DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer: The most flexible and standards-compliant OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.x framework for ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer)\\n> The most flexible and standards-compliant OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.x framework for ASP.NET Core\\n2023-08-06 [Securing SPAs and Blazor Applications using the BFF (Backend for Frontend) Pattern - Dominick Baier - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWJuX-8Ur2k&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGey4D3-wb_2SWTmLJtGHC_j&index=2)\\n\\n2023-08-06 [Securing SPAs and Blazor Applications using the BFF (Backend for Frontend) Pattern - Dominick Baier - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWJuX-8Ur2k&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGey4D3-wb_2SWTmLJtGHC_j&index=2)\\n>  2023-08-06 [YARP Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/)\\n> We found a bunch of internal teams at Microsoft who were either building a reverse proxy for their service or had been asking about APIs and tech for building one, so we decided to get them all together to work on a common solution, this project.

To me, that means two things: introducing the key concepts that you will need in order to [have a good time](https://www.google.com/search?q=super+cool+ski+instructor) reading more serious texts, and providing a narrative that covers things in enough detail that you get a gist of what\'s going on without getting stuck on details. It\'s 2013, you\'ve got the Internet, and you can selectively read more about the topics you find most interesting.\\n>\\n> In my view, much of distributed programming is about dealing with the implications of two consequences of distribution:\\n>\\n> - that information travels at the speed of light\\n> - that independent things fail independently*\\n>\\n> In other words, that the core of distributed programming is dealing with distance (duh!) and having more than one thing (duh!). These constraints define a space of possible system designs, and my hope is that after reading this you\'ll have a better sense of how distance, time and consistency models interact.\\n>\\n> This text is focused on distributed programming and systems concepts you\'ll need to understand commercial systems in the data center. It would be madness to attempt to cover everything. You\'ll learn many key protocols and algorithms (covering, for example, many of the most cited papers in the discipline), including some new exciting ways to look at eventual consistency that haven\'t still made it into college textbooks - such as CRDTs and the CALM theorem.\\n>\\n> I hope you like it!

And if you spot an error, [file a pull request on Github](https://github.com/mixu/distsysbook/issues).\\n>\\n> [The first chapter](https://book.mixu.net/distsys/intro.html) covers distributed systems at a high level by introducing a number of important terms and concepts. It covers high level goals, such as scalability, availability, performance, latency and fault tolerance; how those are hard to achieve, and how abstractions and models as well as partitioning and replication come into play.\\n>\\n> [The second chapter](https://book.mixu.net/distsys/abstractions.html) dives deeper into abstractions and impossibility results. It starts with a Nietzsche quote, and then introduces system models and the many assumptions that are made in a typical system model. It then discusses the CAP theorem and summarizes the FLP impossibility result. It then turns to the implications of the CAP theorem, one of which is that one ought to explore other consistency models. A number of consistency models are then discussed.\\n>\\n> A big part of understanding distributed systems is about understanding time and order. To the extent that we fail to understand and model time, our systems will fail. [The third chapter](https://book.mixu.net/distsys/time.html) discusses time and order, and clocks as well as the various uses of time, order and clocks (such as vector clocks and failure detectors).\\n>\\n> ![image-20230805003412230](./2023-08-04-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230805003412230.png)\\n\\n2023-08-05 Book [Data-Oriented Design](https://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodbook/) Richard Fabian\\n\\n> Online release of Data-Oriented Design :\\n> This is the free, online, reduced version.

It was released in 1989 and has been distributed as the Linux and macOS default shell for a long time.\\n>\\n> So why do we need to learn something that was written more than 30 years ago? The answer is simple: this *something* is today one of the most powerful and portable tools for writing efficient scripts for all Unix-based systems. And that\'s why you should learn bash.

The writer compares the traditional `pthread_once` function and Go\'s `sync.Once` function, highlighting their limitations. \\n>\\n> To overcome these limitations, the author proposes a new \\"once\\" interface that removes callbacks and breaks down initialization into two separate steps, `do_once` and `once_done`. The `do_once` function returns true if initialization is required, otherwise, it returns false after initialization has completed (blocks if it\'s in process). The `once_done` function signals that the initialization process is complete.\\n>\\n> The author\'s approach doesn\'t limit the initialization to global data, and it uses integers to represent the three states of the \\"once\\" object: Uninitialized, Undergoing initialization, and Initialized. This approach allows for zero-initialization, concurrency control with atomic operations, and an optimization for a quicker state transition with an atomic increment. \\n>\\n> In the end, the author presents the implementation details of this new approach, clarifying how it ensures initialization is performed only once and how it handles multiple threads trying to initialize the same piece of data.\\n> ![image-20230804235145362](./2023-08-04-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230804235145362.png)\\n\\n### SIMD\\n\\n2023-07-08 [Packing a string of digits into an integer quickly \u2013 Daniel Lemire\'s blog](https://lemire.me/blog/2023/07/07/packing-a-string-of-digits-into-an-integer-quickly/)\\n\\n```c\\n#include <arm_neon.h>\\n// From \\"20141103 012910\\", we want to get\\n// 0x20141103012910\\nuint64_t extract_nibbles(const char *c) {\\n  const uint8_t *ascii = (const uint8_t *)(c);\\n  uint8x16_t in = vld1q_u8(ascii);\\n  // masking the high nibbles,\\n  in = vandq_u8(in, vmovq_n_u8(0x0f));\\n  // shuffle the bytes\\n  const uint8x16_t shuf = {14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7, 6,\\n    5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 255, 255};\\n  in = vqtbl1q_u8(in, shuf);\\n  // then shift/or\\n  uint16x8_t ins =\\n    vsraq_n_u16(vreinterpretq_u16_u8(in),\\n    vreinterpretq_u16_u8(in), 4);\\n  // then narrow (16->8),\\n  int8x8_t packed = vmovn_u16(ins);\\n  // extract to general register.\\n  return vget_lane_u64(vreinterpret_u64_u16(packed), 0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n## Talks / Security \\n\\n2023-08-04 [Secure Coding Back to Basics - Erlend Oftedal - NDC Security 2022 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3VBNrzRSE)\\n\\n> ![image-20230804234609455](./2023-08-04-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230804234609455.png)\\n>\\n> [cure53/DOMPurify: DOMPurify - a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG.

That way, you at least know you are starting from a good place. If I\u2019m building a component that performs an action, I\u2019ll probably do it in these steps:\\n>\\n> - Step zero is to write a standalone program to perform the action. This ensures that the action is even possible.\\n> - Once I have working code to perform the action, I write a component that *doesn\u2019t* perform an action. That at least makes sure I know how to build a component.\\n> - Next, I register the component for the action, but have the `Invoke` method merely print the message \u201cYay!\u201d to the debugger without doing anything else. This makes sure I know how to get the component to run at the proper time.\\n> - Next, I fill in the `Invoke` method with enough code to identify what action to perform and which object to perform it on, print that information to the debugger, and return without actually performing the action. This makes sure I can identify which action is supposed to be done.\\n> - Finally, I fill in the rest of the `Invoke` method to perform the action on the desired object. For this, I can copy/paste the already-debugged code from step zero.\\n>\\n> > This link came from 2023-07-30 [Programming Digest](https://programmingdigest.net/digests/1688)\\n\\n2023-07-30 [What we talk about when we talk about System Design | mahesh\u2019s blog](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2023/07/12/Design.html/)\\n\\n> The rules for effective design are as follows:\\n>\\n> 1. **Late-bind on designs**: The design process should explore the entire design space rather than converging on a single point solution too early, allowing teams to switch between different possibilities until the best solution is found.\\n> 2. **Each point solution is a DoS attack on the design process**: Discussing designs within the context of the design space accelerates the process, making it easier to compare and iterate on different solutions efficiently.\\n> 3. **Think in parallel; Design together; Implement in parallel; Review together**: The design and development process should be parallelized and divided into creative thinking, centralized design, parallel implementation, and centralized reviewing. Late-binding to developers is crucial for fostering new ideas.\\n> 4. **Talk about the problem, not existing systems**: Designing from first principles is more effective than basing solutions solely on existing systems, as they might introduce unnecessary complexity or bias.\\n> 5. **Always talk about a second application**: Abstractions should be described independently of specific applications to prevent application-specific details from leaking into the abstraction.\\n> 6. **For each abstraction, build one implementation; plan for a second; hope for a third**: Discussing multiple implementations of an abstraction ensures that the semantics of the abstraction remain independent of implementation details.\\n> 7. **Abstraction is not free**: Each abstraction layer adds complexity, requiring precise definitions and reasoning in generic ways. Designers must balance concreteness and abstractness.\\n> 8. **Be critical (but about the right things)**: Designers should critically assess unknown and challenging aspects of a project while recognizing that every well-established system started with rough ideas.\\n>\\n> > This link came from 2023-07-30 [Programming Digest](https://programmingdigest.net/digests/1688)\\n\\n2023-07-25 [Unicode is harder than you think \xb7 mcilloni\'s blog](https://mcilloni.ovh/2023/07/23/unicode-is-hard/)\\n\\n> Reading the excellent article by JeanHeyd Meneide on [how broken string encoding in C/C++ is](https://thephd.dev/the-c-c++-rust-string-text-encoding-api-landscape) made me realise that Unicode is a topic that is often overlooked by a large number of developers. In my experience, there\u2019s a lot of confusion and wrong expectations on what Unicode is, and what best practices to follow when dealing with strings that may contain characters outside of the ASCII range.\\n>\\n> This article attempts to briefly summarise and clarify some of the most common misconceptions I\u2019ve seen people struggle with, and some of the pitfalls that tend to recur in codebases that have to deal with non-ASCII text.\\n\\n2023-07-22 [The Most Important Coding Habits \u2013 PuppyCoding](https://puppycoding.com/2023/07/22/healthy-coding-habits/)\\n\\n> In this article, the author asserts that the most significant coding habits aren\'t related directly to the code itself, but rather those that sustain and enhance a programmer\'s physical health and longevity in the field. This realization comes after suffering from a spinal disc herniation, commonly known as a slipped disc, attributed to poor posture from prolonged keyboard usage.\\n> The author stresses four crucial habits for healthy coding:\\n>\\n> 1. **Daily stretches**: A chiropractor attributed the author\'s slipped disc to the inactivity of stomach and thigh muscles, which should help support the back but become weak due to extended sitting. To alleviate this, they recommend regular stretching exercises, particularly for the central and lower body, to improve muscle suppleness and support.\\n> 2. **Regular breaks**: Taking a short break at least once an hour is advised, which apart from maintaining physical health, also aids in refreshing the mind. Breaks often provide a new perspective, making problem-solving easier upon return.\\n> 3. **Avoid late-night coding**: Working long hours into the night not only leads to poorer quality code but also encourages bad posture. The author suggests establishing a strict cut-off time for work, promoting better mental and physical health.\\n> 4. **Improving the coding environment**: Investing in an ergonomic setup, including a laptop stand, comfortable chair, and a standing desk, can significantly improve posture and reduce strain.\\n>    In conclusion, the author regrets not incorporating these habits sooner and encourages fellow programmers, particularly those early in their career, to learn from their mistakes to enjoy a healthier, more prolonged coding career.\\n\\n2023-07-07 [Excellence is a habit, but so is failure \u2013 Andreas Kling \u2013 I like computers!](https://awesomekling.github.io/Excellence-is-a-habit-but-so-is-failure/)\\n\\n> - I didn\'t become addicted to drugs overnight.

Each CPU has its own L1 and L2 cache, and the L3 cache is shared among all CPUs. When the data finally makes its way inside the L1 or L2 cache, the processor can access it for execution purposes. On Intel architectures the L3 cache maintains a copy of what is in L1 and L2.\\n>\\n> Performance in the end is about how efficiently data can flow into the processor. As you can see from the diagram, main memory access is about 80 times slower than accessing the L1 cache since the data needs to be moved and copied.\\n>\\n> *Note: [Memory Performance in a Nutshell](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/memory-performance-in-a-nutshell.html): The data is from 2016 but what\u2019s important are the latency ratios which are pretty constant.*\\n\\n2023-07-23 [STX: Main Page](https://lamarrr.github.io/STX/)\\n\\n>  [lamarrr/STX: C++17 & C++ 20 error-handling and utility extensions.](https://github.com/lamarrr/STX)\\n>  These monadic types not only make error handling easier but also make the paths more obvious to the compiler for optimizations.

These functions take an input, often a string, and generate a number. If a good hash function is used, it will always return the same number for the same input, while minimizing \'collisions\' where different inputs produce the same number. This article evaluates the performance of hash functions, highlighting their efficacy with random and non-random inputs. An effective hash function, like the widely-used murmur3, provides even distribution regardless of input. The \'avalanche effect\' is another measure of a good hash function, where a single change in the input results in an average 50% change in the output bits. Understanding hash functions is essential in utilizing key-value pair storing data structures known as maps.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Books\\n\\n2023-05-07 [A Programmer\'s Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org/)\\n\\n> ![image-20230702155147644](./2023-06-28-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230702155147644.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Azure Active Directory\\n\\n2023-06-29 [Demystifying OAuth, JWTs and Azure AD - Graeme Foster - NDC Oslo 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmvXoW0r83I)\\n\\n> Good video by Graeme Foster about how AAD OAuth works with demos.

It made it significantly easier for ships, airplanes, cars, and hikers to figure out where they are with high degree of accuracy.\\n\\n> One of the most exciting aspects of this system are the satellites surrounding Earth. Here\u2019s a current constellation of active satellites, you can drag the view around to see it from different angles:\\n>\\n> ![image-20230608160152904](./2023-06-08-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230608160152904.png)\\n\\n2023-06-03 [The Pluto Scarab \u2014 Hash Functions](https://papa.bretmulvey.com/post/124027987928/hash-functions)\\n\\n> Hash Functions\\n>\\n> Hash functions are functions that map a bit vector to another bit vector, usually shorter than the original vector and usually of fixed length for a particular function.\\n>\\n> There are three primary uses for hash functions:\\n>\\n> 1. Fast table lookup\\n> 2. Message digests\\n> 3. Encryption\\n>\\n> **Fast Table Lookup**\\n>\\n> Fast table lookup can be implemented using a hash function and a hash table. Elements are found in the hash table by calculating the hash of the element\u2019s key and using the hash value as the index into the table. This is clearly faster than other methods, such as examining each element of the table sequentially to find a match.\\n>\\n> **Message Digests**\\n>\\n> Message digests allow you to compare two large bit vectors and quickly determine if they are equal. Instead of comparing the vectors bit-by-bit, if the hash values of each bit vector are available you can compare the hash values. If the hash values are different, the original vectors must be different. If the hash values are the same then the original vectors are very likely to be the same if the hash function is good.\\n>\\n> Message digests can use either cryptographic or non-cryptographic hash functions. If the purpose of the message digest is to determine if the original message has been tampered with, you would need to use a cryptographic hash function. If you just want to quickly tell if it\u2019s the same as another file with a different name (assuming the hash values have already been computed), you can use a non-cryptographic hash function.\\n>\\n> **Encryption**\\n>\\n> Encryption is the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone without a secret decryption key. Hash functions play an important role in encryption because it is their properties that cause the encrypted data to be unreadable and the original data to be unrecoverable from the encrypted data without the decryption key.\\n>\\n> ![image-20230608160538570](./2023-06-08-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230608160538570.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Fun\\n\\n2023-06-02 [Fold \'N Fly \xbb Paper Airplane Folding Instructions](https://www.foldnfly.com/#/1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-2)\\n\\n> ![image-20230608160715423](./2023-06-08-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230608160715423.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Mental Health\\n\\n2023-05-15 [Taxonomy of procrastination](https://dynomight.net/procrastination/)\\n\\n> ADHD and procrastination\\n>\\n> What I\u2019d like to understand is: Is there a failure mode from having too much willpower?\\n>\\n> There\u2019s an angle on this that seems promising at first.

So is there a problem associated with having \u201ctoo much\u201d dopamine? Perhaps yes\u2014the [dopamine hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_hypothesis_of_schizophrenia) is that an overly sensitive dopamine system (or [taking lots of meth](https://dynomight.net/p2p-meth/)) causes schizophrenia.\\n>\\n> As a cartoon, we might think that:\\n>\\n> LOW DOPAMINE\\n> \u2193\\n> LOW CONFIDENCE IN PREDICTIONS\\n> \u2193\\n> FORGET HOMEWORK PLAY VIDEO GAMES\\n>\\n> And:\\n>\\n> HIGH DOPAMINE\\n> \u2193\\n> EXTREME CONFIDENCE IN PREDICTIONS\\n> \u2193\\n> HALLUCINATIONS\\n>\\n> Nice theory, right?

As described in the book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a flow state allows one to become fully engaged and focused on the task at hand. It leads to better results and greater happiness. But it can only happen when you have the attention to focus fully on whatever it is that lies before you.\\n> Why can\u2019t we focus at work?\\n> The contemporary workspace, whether in-person or remote, is full of demands on your attention. We have chat programs, email inboxes, and project management apps all throwing notifications our way. In offices, you have other people tapping you on the shoulder and creating general noise (and woe betide those in open offices). Working remotely avoids some of these, but places the entire communication burden on chat and email applications with their little red notifications.

A week before their joining, we ship the laptop\\n> 2. I\'d have a calendar ready for them, which gives an overview of what they will be doing for the next three months\\n> 3. First week goes into setting up the tooling on the machine. Someone from the product team gives an overview and entire product walkthrough. Next, they spend some to play with the product as a user. This week also involves the initial orientation session.\\n> 4. We use Golang heavily, however, the people joining might not know it. The second week goes into doing the tour of Go.\\n> 5. Third week they spend on onboarding tutorial that shows how to write a small service, generate APIs, build, and deploy it in our infra.\\n> 6. Fourth week they will spend shipping a really small feature to the production.\\n> 7. Since day one, they\'d have assigned a buddy who becomes their go-to person. Buddy also explains them about the culture, how things typical done here etc. The buddy also creates a new slack channel just for them, where they can interact.\\n> 8. They pair with the buddy in the initial weeks, where buddy is the driver.\\n> 9. First three months, they\'d spend working on a feature along with someone which also involves some good amount of pair programming.\\n>\\n> [ Tehnix](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tehnix)\\n\\n> \\n> - Before you start we send an onboarding plan: As detailed as we can for the first 7 days (e.g. onboarding call, intro to this or that, pairing up with another Engineer), and much more high-level of expectations after 30 days and after 3 months\\n> \\n> - Everyone has an \\"onboarding buddy\\": This is an Engineer on their team and makes sure the other Engineer feels like it\'s their responsibility to spend time getting the new Engineer up-to-speed\\n> \\n> - If you\'re fully remote we try to fly you into our HQ (Copenhagen, Denmark) for the first week. We\'ve had overwhelmingly good feedback on how big of a difference this makes in establishing connections and making people feel a lot more comfortable with the colleagues much earlier on.\\n> \\n> - We focus on giving you a lot of context initially: The organization, the team and their purpose, meeting up with your manager weekly so they can fill in the gaps continuously, intro to the overall tech infrastructure\\n> \\n> - We dive into the specifics via work: Finding smaller projects that are well scoped to get you into the various corners of the teams\' domain\\n> \\n> - We knowledge share a lot via PR Reviews: Onboardees always add two people on the PRs to maximize knowledge sharing over speed initially. After a month or two they go down to just the regular 1 person and they themselves also start reviewing code\\n> \\n> - From then on: We freestyle, but have a continuous focus on learning. At this point, people are so unique and varied that we adjust on to their learning style, gaps, etc.\\n> \\n> Everyone in the team is quite communicative. One thing we explicitly focus on is for new people to get comfortable asking in public channels instead of via DMs. This comes naturally to some, but not to others and they need some nudging and you showing off how its safe to do.\\n> \\n> There\'s many more things we do, but those are some of the important parts of the top of my head :)\\n> \\n> EDIT: Some context around our environment. We have our own CLI tool to quickly setup a dev environment as well as using GitHub Codespaces as a fallback. There\'s strong coverage of CI for checking everything is good, and things are deployed very often.

Programs need to be loaded from your hard drive into memory before they can be run. While running, the majority of what programs do is load values from memory, do some computation on them, and then store the result back in memory.\\n>\\n> In this post I\'m going to introduce you to the basics of memory allocation. Allocators exist because it\'s not enough to have memory available, you need to use it effectively. We will visually explore how simple allocators work. We\'ll see some of the problems that they try to solve, and some of the techniques used to solve them. At the end of this post, you should know everything you need to know to write your own allocator.\\n>\\n> ![image-20230528170203659](./2023-05-28-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230528170203659.png)\\n\\n## Research on RSS readers\\n\\nI haven\'t found the one that I like yet.\\n\\n2023-05-26 [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/)\\n\\n2023-05-26 [yang991178/fluent-reader: Modern desktop RSS reader built with Electron, React, and Fluent UI](https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader)\\n\\n2023-05-26 [stringer-rss/stringer: A self-hosted, anti-social RSS reader.](https://github.com/stringer-rss/stringer)\\n\\n2023-05-26 \ud83d\udc43 [Athou/commafeed: Google Reader inspired self-hosted RSS reader.](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Talks\\n\\n2023-05-22 [Developer Tools That Shouldn\'t Be Secrets Christian Heilmann  GOTO 2022 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz-nUdotdx4)\\n\\n> ![image-20230528170557079](./2023-05-28-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230528170557079.png)\\n>\\n> Slides\\n> 2023-05-22 [More devtools secrets](https://codepo8.github.io/more-developer-tools-tricks/)\\n> Console.log\\n> to show variable name in the output, instead of console.log(x), put curly braces\\n> `console.log({x})`\\n> so the output will be an object with one property.\\n>\\n> 2023-05-22 [Dear Console,\u2026 - a collection of code snippets to use in the browser console](https://codepo8.github.io/dearconsole/)\\n>\\n> ![image-20230528170512157](./2023-05-28-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230528170512157.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nSee ya!"},{"id":"/2023/05/21/links-from-my-inbox","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/05/21/links-from-my-inbox","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2023-05-21-links-from-my-inbox.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-21-links-from-my-inbox.md","title":"Links from my inbox 2023-05-21","description":"image-20230521155535651","date":"2023-05-21T22:52:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 21, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":5.365,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox 2023-05-21","date":"2023-05-21T22:52:00.000Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2023-05-28","permalink":"/blog/2023/05/28/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox 2023-05-19","permalink":"/blog/2023/05/19/links-from-my-inbox"}},"content":"![image-20230521155535651](./2023-05-21-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230521155535651.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Good reads\\n\\n2023-05-21 [Why is OAuth still hard in 2023? | Nango Blog](https://www.nango.dev/blog/why-is-oauth-still-hard)\\n\\n> Which parameters do they require in the authorize call?\\n>\\n> - For Jira, the audience parameter is key (and must be set to a specific fixed value).

If you\u2019re looking to implement the current security best practices, the OAuth working group has a [rather lengthy guide](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics) for you. And if you\u2019re working with an API that is still using OAuth 1.0a today, you realize that backwards compatibility is a never-ending struggle.\\n>\\n> Luckily, security is getting better with every iteration, but it often comes at the cost of more work for developers.

Because he had a higher-level, longer-term perspective and had been a manager for longer, he was often able to point out ways I was having a big impact without noticing.\\n> - I asked people for feedback. I found that if I just asked \u201cdo you have any feedback for me?\u201d people often wouldn\u2019t, but if I asked more granular questions\u2014\u201cwas that meeting useful?\u201d\u2014I would usually learn a lot from it.

I know I would need one. So here it is :\\n>\\n> I\u2019ve always had focus issues but I misdiagnosed them as problems related to energy. Through school and career I found that the only reliable way for me to motivate myself was to generate stress and consume an unhealthy amount of caffeine. At first doing work just before it\u2019s due, and later in life harnessing it in a more healthy manner by faking early deadlines. Late 2021 I got sick and I couldn\u2019t drink caffeine anymore and stress caused me a good deal of pain. Thought my career was over, so I turned to my doctor and she sent me to be evaluated for ADHD and Bipolar. Turns out I have ADHD and the medication has given me a new lease on life.

Instead of the usual tables or documents that are the central focus of most databases, with Redis, you interact directly with low-level data structures such as linked lists and hash tables.\\n>\\n> This is all thanks to the innovative design of Redis creator [Salvatore Sanfilippo](http://invece.org/), known online as *antirez*. A master in system programming, antirez prefers to think in terms of data structures like lists, hashes, and sets. The higher-level data representations, such as tables or documents, just didn\'t suit his taste. When creating Redis, antirez was an amateur in the database field. But perhaps it was this lack of experience that allowed him to bring fresh ideas to the industry.\\n\\n2023-05-07 [Scaling up the Prime Video audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90% - Prime Video Tech](https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90)\\n\\n> Me: Wow, Amazon, thank you for transparency! \\n>\\n> At Prime Video, we offer thousands of live streams to our customers.

B. Houmann](https://bagerbach.com/books/grokking-simplicity)\\n> NOTES ON\\n> Grokking Simplicity: Taming complex software with functional thinking\\n> by Eric Normand\\n>\\n>  Immutability\\n>\\n> Copy-on-write\\n>\\n> Implementing copy-on-write operations can help with immutability.\\n>\\n> E.g. for adding items to arrays: slice the array (to copy), push the item to the array copy, and return the copied array.\\n>\\n> Then you avoid modifying the original.\\n>\\n> The basic steps of implementing copy-on-write are:\\n>\\n> 1. Make a copy\\n> 2. Modify copy as you like\\n> 3. Return copy\\n>\\n> Using copy-on-write, you convert write operation into read operations - you never modify the original data.\\n>\\n> You can generalize most of these operations, so you don\'t have to implement copy & return every time you wish to modify something. Take for example this removeItems operation, which is the copy-on-write version of splice:\\n>\\n> ```js\\n> function removeItems(array, idx, count) {\\n>     const copy = array.slice();\\n>     copy.splice(idx, count);\\n>     return copy;\\n> }\\n> ```\\n>\\n> How do you make something that both reads and writes copy-on-write? Take `Array.shift` for example. You can either split the function into read & write, or you can return two values from the function. The former is preferable. `shift` shifts an array one to the left, i.e. it drops the 0 index element and then returns it. You can imitate the latter part of that operation by simply returning `array[0]`. You can convert the dropping of the 0th element to copy-on-write quite trivially as well: make a copy, use `shift` on the copy, and then return the copy.\\n>\\n> And this is what the copy-on-write `shift` operation returning two values would look like:\\n>\\n> ```js\\n> function shift(array) {\\n>     const array_copy = array.slice();\\n>     const first = array_copy.shift();\\n>     return {first, array: array_copy};\\n> }\\n> ```\\n\\n2023-04-24 [Is Critical Thinking the Most Important Skill for Software Engineers? - The Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/critical-thinking/)\\n\\n> I still remember being in a meeting where a Very Respected Engineer was explaining how they are building a project, and they said something along the lines of \\"and, of course, idempotency is non-negotiable.\\" I didn\'t know what idempotency was, and thus I could not tell why it was non-negotiable.

Last August I lost a good childhood friend of mine and took it pretty hard. When I was visiting my hometown for his funeral, I connected with his parents who shared with me some of his old belongings. Among them was a copy of an old map of his backed up on a 3.5\u201d floppy from high school. Thomas and I were into amateur Doom mapping in the early 00s but I had never seen this map of his prior to uncovering it on one of the old floppy discs. As a way of paying tribute to him and all the great memories we had together, I took the plunge and installed Doom Builder in order to polish up his map and add a few modern amenities just for convenience sake.\\n>\\n> [Download myhouse.wad](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Nx7kUQwmxUGoXqL6FiUwFY--up64fgo?usp=share_link)\\n\\n2023-05-20 [Street Fighter II, paper trails](https://fabiensanglard.net/sf2_sheets/index.html)\\n\\n> ![image-20230519221418804](./2023-05-19-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230519221418804.png)\\n\\n2023-04-28 [Delphi 11 and C++Builder 11 Community Editions Released!](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/delphi-11-and-cbuilder-11-community-editions-released/)\\n\\n> Great News!\\n>\\n> ![image-20230519223847733](./2023-05-19-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230519223847733.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Projects\\n\\n2023-05-20 [Map of GitHub](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-github/)\\n\\n> Apache Spark in Bigdatia!\\n>\\n> ![image-20230519214008555](./2023-05-19-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20230519214008555.png)\\n>\\n> Thank you, Vu! \\n\\n2023-05-20 [pixpaint](https://warms.maxbittker.repl.co/)\\n\\n> how do I describe this?

It\u2019s exhausting! Distracting yourself is fairly common advice, but it\u2019s a bit like trying to ignore a splinter.

Worse yet, it might get inflamed and cause more problems down the line.\\n>\\n> Here\u2019s a more productive approach that allowed so many of my clients to get lasting relief from rumination:\\n>\\n> 1.

Use principles from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology to understand the latest from Mars, comprehend the outer solar system, ponder planets outside our solar system, and search for habitability in our neighborhood and beyond. This course is generally taught at an advanced level assuming a prior knowledge of undergraduate math and physics, but the majority of the concepts and lectures can be understood without these prerequisites. The quizzes and final exam are designed to make you think critically about the material you have learned rather than to simply make you memorize facts. The class is expected to be challenging but rewarding.*\\n>\\n> It is also taught at Caltech, see https://mikebrown.caltech.edu/teaching/science-solar-system\\n>\\n> Databases by prof. Widom, from Stanford. Currently the course is at edX, and split into 5 mini-courses.

Lil\'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-09-25-train-large/) \\n\\n> In recent years, we are seeing better results on many NLP benchmark tasks with larger pre-trained [language models](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-lm/). How to train large and deep neural networks is challenging, as it demands a large amount of GPU memory and a long horizon of training time.\\n>\\n> However an individual GPU worker has limited memory and the sizes of many large models have grown beyond a single GPU. There are several parallelism paradigms to enable model training across multiple GPUs, as well as a variety of model architecture and memory saving designs to help make it possible to train *very large* neural networks.\\n\\n2023-01-25 [Event Hubs ingestion performance and throughput Vincent-Philippe Lauzon\u2019s](https://vincentlauzon.com/2018/06/05/event-hubs-ingestion-performance-and-throughput/)\\n\\n>  Here are some recommendations in the light of the performance and throughput results:\\n>\\n> - If we send **many events**: always reuse connections, i.e. do not create a connection only for one event. This is valid for both AMQP and HTTP. A simple [Connection Pool pattern](https://github.com/vplauzon/streaming/blob/master/ClientPerf/ClientConsole/EventHubClientPool.cs) makes this easy.\\n> - If we send **many events** & **throughput** is a concern: use AMQP.\\n> - If we send **few events** and **latency** is a concern: use HTTP / REST.\\n> - If events naturally comes in **batch of many events**: use batch API.\\n> - If events **do not** naturally comes in **batch of many events**: simply stream events. **Do not try** to batch them unless network IO is constrained.\\n> - If a **latency** of **0.1 seconds** is a concern: move the call to Event Hubs away from your critical performance path.\\n>\\n> Let\u2019s now look at the tests we did to come up with those recommendations.\\n\\n## Projects\\n\\n2023-01-13 [GitHub - sickcodes/Docker-OSX](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX) \\n\\n>  Run macOS VM in a Docker!

Tracing Emergent Abilities of Language Models to their Sources](https://yaofu.notion.site/How-does-GPT-Obtain-its-Ability-Tracing-Emergent-Abilities-of-Language-Models-to-their-Sources-b9a57ac0fcf74f30a1ab9e3e36fa1dc1)\\n\\n> There are three important abilities that the initial GPT-3 exhibit:\\n>\\n> - **Language generation**: to follow a prompt and then generate a completion of the given prompt. Today, this might be the most ubiquitous way of human-LM interaction.\\n> - **In-context learning**: to follow a few examples of a given task and then generate the solution for a new test case. It is interesting to note that, although being a language model, the original GPT-3 paper barely talks about \u201clanguage modeling\u201d \u2014 the authors devoted their writing efforts to their visions of in-context learning, which is the real focus of GPT-3.\\n> - **World knowledge**: including factual knowledge and commonsense.\\n>\\n> Where do these abilities come from?\\n>\\n> Generally, the above three abilities should come from large-scale pretraining \u2014 to pretrain the 175B parameters model on 300B tokens (60% 2016 - 2019 C4 + 22% WebText2 + 16% Books + 3% Wikipedia). Where:\\n>\\n> - The **language generation** ability comes from the language modeling **training objective**.\\n> - The **world knowledge** comes from the 300B token **training corpora** (or where else it could be).\\n> - The **175B model size** is for **storing knowledge**, which is further evidenced by Liang et al. (2022), who conclude that the performance on tasks requiring knowledge correlates with model size.\\n> - The source of the **in-context learning** ability, as well as its generalization behavior, **is still elusive**. Intuitively, this ability may come from the fact that data points of the same task are ordered sequentially in the same batch during pretraining. Yet there is little study on why language model pretraining induces in-context learning, and why in-context learning behaves so differently than fine-tuning.\\n\\n\\n## Fun\\n\\n2022-12-16 [Meet Ghostwriter, a haunted AI-powered typewriter that talks to you Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/meet-ghostwriter-a-haunted-ai-powered-typewriter-that-talks-to-you/)\\n\\n> On Wednesday, a designer and engineer named Arvind Sanjeev revealed his process for creating Ghostwriter, a one-of-a-kind repurposed Brother typewriter that uses AI to chat with a person typing on the keyboard.

If boost::unordered_map strictly adheres to the C++ specification for std::unordered_map, boost::unordered_flat_map deviates in a number of ways from the standard to offer dramatic performance improvements in exchange; in fact, boost::unordered_flat_map ranks amongst the fastest hash containers currently available to C++ users.\\n\\n- 2022-11-17 [foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM: Tools to set up a quick macOS VM in QEMU, accelerated by KVM.](https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM)\\n\\n  >  So... it is here in C++... because how else would you test your opensource C++ with no apple device?\\n\\n- 2022-11-13 [AnalogJ/scrutiny: Hard Drive S.M.A.R.T Monitoring, Historical Trends & Real World Failure Thresholds](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny)\\n\\n  >  If you run a server with more than a couple of hard drives, you\'re probably already familiar with S.M.A.R.T and the `smartd` daemon.

These relationships are, however, sensitive to the time we invest in them. To understand how and why this should be, we first outline the evolutionary background in primate sociality from which our human social world has emerged. We then review defining features of that human sociality, putting forward a framework within which one can understand the consequences of mass social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, including mental health deterioration, stress, sleep disturbance and substance misuse. We outline recent research on the neural basis of prolonged social isolation, highlighting especially higher-order neural circuits such as the default mode network. Our survey of studies covers the negative effects of prolonged social deprivation and the multifaceted drivers of day-to-day pandemic experiences.\\n\\n## Free Ads!\\n\\n![image-20221113131540522](./2022-11-13-links-from-my-inbox.assets/image-20221113131540522.png)\\n\\nHow do I explain Barista that I want a dark bitter coffee, without getting \\"brown\\"  sour one at the end?"},{"id":"/2022/11/07/links-from-my-inbox-november-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/11/07/links-from-my-inbox-november-2022","editUrl":"https://github.com/dzharii/dzharii.github.io/blog/2022-11-07-links-from-my-inbox-november-2022.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-07-links-from-my-inbox-november-2022.md","title":"Links from my inbox November 07 2022","description":"image-20221105175930749","date":"2022-11-07T17:41:17.019Z","formattedDate":"November 7, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":8.01,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Links from my inbox November 07 2022","date":"2022-11-07T17:41:17.019Z","categories":"links"},"prevItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox November 13 2022","permalink":"/blog/2022/11/13/links-from-my-inbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Links from my inbox October 04 2022","permalink":"/blog/2022/10/07/links-from-my-inbox-october-2022"}},"content":"![image-20221105175930749](./2022-11-07-links-from-my-inbox-november-2022.assets/image-20221105175930749.png)\\n\\n## Good reads\\n\\n- 2022-11-05 [Folklore.org: -2000 Lines Of Code](https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt)\\n\\n  > -2000 Lines Of Code\\n  > Author: Andy Hertzfeld\\n  > Date:  February 1982\\n  > Characters: Bill Atkinson\\n  > Topics: Software Design, Management, Lisa\\n  > Summary:   It\'s hard to measure progress by lines of code\\n\\n- 2022-11-04 [Use RSS for privacy and efficiency :: rsapkf/www](https://rsapkf.org/weblog/q2z)\\n\\n  > Social media sites are riddled with ads, trackers, and dark patterns.

I recently transitioned from having lived my whole life doing the kind of jobs you could do with zero day\u2019s training and no developed skills. I\u2019ve heard the phrase (and some classier high-end equivalents) since then, but it\u2019s used much differently; it\u2019s describing a different set of worries as experienced by a different kind of person living a different sort of life.\\n> The Author - [Resident Contrarian on Substack](https://substack.com/profile/11885401-resident-contrarian) - writes about different kinds of people issues.\\n\\n## Good old reads\\n- 2022-05-16 [Crash-only software: More than meets the eye LWN.net](https://lwn.net/Articles/191059/)\\n- 2022-05-16 [Crash-Only Thinking](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/10/29/crash-only-thinking/)\\n> A few weeks ago, I learned about something called crash-only software (ht, Robert Greco). This is software that has no normal \u201cstart\u201d or \u201cstop\u201d mechanisms. It can only be stopped by crashing it. Often this means unplugging the computer physically.\\n- 2022-05-16 [The properties of crash-only software - Marc\'s Blog](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2012/01/22/crash-only.html)\\n> My thoughts about a classic paper\\n- 2022-05-21 [Crash-only software: More than meets the eye 2006 Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8464573)\\n```\\nBecause of that I usually make all my services and systems crash only. End up using things like use atomic file moves, open files with append-only, use kill -9 to stop services and so on. To make your system crash-onl,y you have to go down the base system calls.\\nSome observed effects so far (many are covered in the article):\\n* Faster restarts (if your regular operation involves restarting lots of processes).\\n* Less code (don\'t have to handle both the clean shutdown and dirty shutdown).\\n* Recovery/cleanup code if it is needed, is often ends up moved to startup instead of shutdown (you might have to recover corrupt files when you start up again. For example re-truncate the files to a known offset based on some index).\\n* Something else might need to manage external resources (OS IPC resources, shared memory, IPC message queues etc). This could be a supervisor process.\\n* If you do a lot of socket operations on localhost, your sockets could get stuck in TIME_WAIT state and you\'ll eventually run out of ephemeral ports if you do a lot of restarts (say during testing). SIGTERM signals often are caught and processes (libraries) perform a cleaner shutdown.\\n* Think very well about the database you use and see if it can can support crash only operation. Some do some don\'t ( I won\'t name any names here ).\\n```\\n- 2022-05-21 [Files are hard](https://danluu.com/file-consistency/)\\n> on exactly how hard it is to save data without corruption or data loss \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## How the things work\\n- 2022-05-14 [Time-series compression algorithms, explained](https://www.timescale.com/blog/time-series-compression-algorithms-explained/)\\n> Delta-delta encoding, Simple-8b, XOR-based compression, and more - These algorithms aren\'t magic, but combined they can save over 90% of storage costs and speed up queries.
