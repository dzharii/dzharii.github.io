In practice, you will eventually need to insert between two ids that have no free integer between them. For example, suppose you have ids ","[3]"," and ","[4]",", and someone wants to insert one more character between them. There is no integer strictly between 3 and 4, so LSEQ drops to a deeper level. It creates a two-component id, for example ","[3,5]",". When you compare ids, ","[3,5]"," still sorts between ","[3]"," and ","[4]",", because first you compare the first component: 3 equals 3, then you compare the second component, 5, which is less than 4 by definition of how that level is constructed."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"A14 Because ids are vectors of integers and not just single numbers, the CRDT can always proceed by adding a deeper component when it runs out of space at the current level.

Over time this gives you a tree shape inside the id space, even though you interact with it as a sorted sequence."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},'A15 Deletion works in a similar fashion. There is no "delete at index 2" in the CRDT protocol. There is "delete the character that has id ',"[5]",'". When Alice deletes that character, she marks id ',"[5]"," as removed in her model. When Bob later receives this deletion operation, he also removes the character associated with id ","[5]"," from his model. Since both replicas drop the same id, they both agree on which character disappeared. They then sort the remaining ids and reach the same view."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"A16 This example shows the main ideas without the full tree representation. The model stores characters keyed by immutable ids. Insertion generates a fresh id between two neighboring ids. Deletion removes the character for a specific id. Replicas exchange operations that mention these ids, not raw indices. Each replica independently maintains a set of entries and derives a view by sorting them.

The path is the list of integers you already saw, for example ","[3]",", ","[3,7]",", ","[3,7,9]",". The replica identifier is a value that is globally unique per device or browser session, such as a UUID or random 128-bit number. The counter is a number that starts at 0 on each replica and is incremented every time that replica allocates a new id. Once you create a triple (path, replicaId, counter) you never change any part of it again; that is where immutability comes from."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"Uniqueness comes from combining the path with the replica identifier and counter. Two replicas may occasionally choose the same path when inserting between the same neighbors, but because they have different replica identifiers they still produce different overall ids. Even on a single replica, the counter ensures you never accidentally reuse the same (path, replicaId) pair twice. When you compare ids to sort characters, you use a fixed lexicographic rule: first compare paths component by component; if the paths are equal, compare replicaId; if still equal, compare counter. That comparison rule is the same on every replica, so they all derive the same total order."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"The interesting part is how to generate a new path between two neighbors. Suppose you want to insert between left path L and right path R. At some depth d you look at the d-th component of L and R. If they differ and there is room between them, you choose a random integer between them at that depth, and copy the prefix from the left side. For example, if L is ","[3]"," and R is ","[7]",", you can choose 4, 5, or 6 as the new component and get a path ","[5]",". Because 3 < 5 < 7, ","[5]"," will sort between the two neighbors on all replicas. If there is no room between L and R at the current depth, you go one level deeper. For example, if L is ","[3]"," and R is ","[4]",", there is no integer strictly between 3 and 4, so you extend the shorter path. You might treat L as ","[3,0]"," and R as ","[4,0]"," conceptually, or you might define a depth-dependent base, and then pick a number between those new bounds at the deeper level, for example ","[3,5]",". Now ","[3,5]"," still sorts between ","[3]"," and ","[4]"," because you compare 3 with 3 first, then 5 with the implicit 4 at that depth according to your scheme. The LSEQ paper chooses these ranges carefully and often uses randomness within them so that, over time, insertions are spread out and the tree stays fairly balanced."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"Once you have a procedure like that, generating a new id when a user inserts a character looks like this in words. You take the id of the character just before the insertion point and the id of the character just after it. You run your \u201callocate path between L and R\u201d procedure to get a fresh path. You increment your local counter. You form the id as (newPath, replicaId, counter). You attach that id to the inserted character. After that, that id is frozen forever: you never edit it, and you never reuse it."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"Deletions then talk only about existing ids. When a user deletes a character, the operation you broadcast is \u201cdelete id X\u201d. Every replica that receives that operation finds the entry with id X and removes it or marks it deleted. Because ids never change and are globally unique, every replica removes the same character. Insertions only ever introduce new ids, never modify old ones. Deletions only ever remove existing ids, never create new ones. As replicas exchange these operations, each one ends up with the same set of ids and associated characters, and because the comparison rule is deterministic and based on immutable fields, sorting them always yields the same order."),(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"So the recipe is: design ids as immutable tuples that include a path, a globally unique replica identifier, and a per-replica counter; define a deterministic lexicographic comparison over those fields; implement a \u201cpick a path between two paths\u201d function that can always find a new path by going deeper when necessary and that tends to keep the tree balanced.

The combination reduces edge-case complexity and makes offline-capable apps practical beyond demos.")))}m.isMDXComponent=!0},18429:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20250929162449926-34fb1bcd3de5349de87920ec8c7a370c.png"},572:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251026213014196-43adaa9fc7c0f296c86def30929d0f4f.png"},11153:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251129110810492-026fac971948c86ddb77a8c116a828a6.png"},81140:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251129112659154-f79c15dd58d05e94fd34481df3549239.png"},93010:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251129235241699-2ac311a4668df6712e1e86dacb992c39.png"},6712:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251130105613938-a1b36ef0095154913547d77c1c815430.png"},70403:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251201233349962-8c81835cf60e5dcc7090b014dc767d9b.png"},45791:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251201233518746-7de21e49490dda038da0f90e7c3b4623.png"},27766:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251201235239094-009993259064d3631f4cd445c444fa3e.png"},54702:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251206114520819-b0535bfcecd11916dde60f56b523f09f.png"},19264:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20251206120639388-2d1a8fb17b9b0d09243849fabbb5f3ff.png"},40089:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image-20260110002236729-5ddb39e88d5cdd630bfa61c2f63238a7.png"}}]);
