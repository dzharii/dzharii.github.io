You don't have to go and look anywhere else.\n  \u2015 Ajahn Chah\n\n  Man has set for himself the goal of conquering the world,\n  but in the process he loses his soul.\n  \u2015 Alexander Solzhenitsyn\n\n  The wise man knows the Self,\n  And he plays the game of life.\n  But the fool lives in the world\n  Like a beast of burden.\n  \u2015 Ashtavakra Gita (4\u20151)\n\n  We must be true inside, true to ourselves,\n  before we can know a truth that is outside us.\n  \u2015 Thomas Merton\n\n  Saying yes frequently is an additive strategy.
